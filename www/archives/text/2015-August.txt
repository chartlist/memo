Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size hard fork
Message-ID: <CAAO2FKFQjjftgEgZoDAUrMxa86KTbNzAqg+xgExTRPpGxedwRw@mail.gmail.com>

I haven't seen much discussion on this list of what will happen when the
blockchain forks due to larger blocks. I think the debate surrounding this
issue is a storm in a teacup, because transactions on the smaller chain can
and will appear on the bigger chain also. There is nothing tying
transactions to the blocks they appear in.

Miners will migrate to the bigger chain in search of higher profits due to
higher volume of fees. They can also collect the higher fees of the smaller
chain by including into the bigger chain as many as possible of the
transactions from the smaller chain.

To stop this from happening the smaller chain would somehow need to change
the serialized format of their transactions so the signatures would no
longer be valid across chains.

Incidentally I read somewhere that the losing chain would have their coins
sold down. Trying to sell the smaller chain's coins in the short term at
least is not advisable, as those transactions will appear on the bigger
chain too.

Transactions can be recieved or accepted in different orders by
different nodes. The purpose of the blockchain is to resolve any
potential conflicting transactions by providing a globally agreed
total ordering.

As soon as one of the forks accepts a different transaction in a
conflicting set then there will be transactions which exist on one
chain which cannot exist on the other.

One can quite easily transact in a way to intentionally produce such a
split to seperate the existance of your coins onto the seperate forks;
just as anyone would need to do to perform a reorg-and-respend attack
on a single blockchain.

Additionally, new coins will be issued, along with fees, on both
chains. These new outputs become spendable after 100 blocks, and any
transaction spending them can exist exclusively on one chain.

Also any transaction whos casual history extends from one of the above
cases can exist only on one chain. This also means that someone who
has single-chain coins (via a conflict or from coinbase outputs) can
pay small amount to many users to get their wallets to consume them
and make more of the transactions single chain only-- if they wanted
the process to happen faster.

> Miners will migrate to the bigger chain in search of higher profits due to higher volume of fees

The migration remark is a considerable oversimplification. Imagine if
I released a version of the software programmed to reassign ownership
of a million of the earliest created unmoved coins to me at block
400k, and then after that I made transaction to pay 5 coin/block in
fees. Would miners move to this chain?  It pays more in fees!

Right. Why anyone would want to do this intentionally, however, is not
clear. The coins would be worth less as they wouldn't be fungible across
the chains anymore.

This is something that hadn't entered my mind when I made my assertions. At
the moment I can't see any way to avoid this fact.

Also any transaction whos casual history extends from one of the above

Wallets could detect this and notify the user. Due to Gresham's Law, I'll
admit the observation that these outputs would likely get spent in
preference (as they are less fungible), but whether the payee would be
happy to accept them is a different matter.

Well in your example they wouldn't, because they know that your version
wouldn't be accepted by the economic majority. But it's not as clear cut
for the larger blocks case. They may move over gradually as they see the
new chain gain acceptance, demonstrated by the higher trading volume on it.

I took Tier's comment to mean that the commit hash (taken from git) of
the BIP for the particular hard fork being rolled out via your hard
fork bit mechanism could be used in the coinbase.
The commit for the BIP is separate from the commit for the code
changes implementing it.

By using the commit hash of the BIP, it means that the BIP cannot
specify itself what to put in the coinbase.
I'd suggest that your hard fork bit proposal allows BIP authors to
specify, within a 20 byte limit (to let them ripe160 a message or
something), the unique value to use.
This would be just as well and would allow the specific hard fork BIPs
to be updated without having to make code changes (e.g.- for simple
grammatical updates, post deployment clarification, etc...).

Perhaps more preferable, in order to keep the coinbases small, or, if
you're worried about BIP authors using duplicate values, then just
specify in your proposal that the coinbase message include
"BIP<NUMBER>" as BIP numbers are not going to be reused. All you are
trying to achieve is something that can be uniquely pattern matched.

Are the reasons for your use of the coinbase message 1) to guard
against one or more hard forks piggy-backing on another's flag block,
without prior collaboration, and 2) to have a nicer message in the
alerting system? If so, you might want to spell that out in your
proposal. At first, I was thinking that the coinbase thing was not
entirely necessary since the possibility of multiple hard forks taking
place concurrently is low. Multiple forking changes could be
coordinated to all use the same possible voting mechanisms, median
timestamp, and thus flag block. But if the concern is about competing
hard forks where two or more forks abandon the original chain and
attempt to use the same checkpoint block, then I can see why you'd
need it.

I was reading this proposal alongside another of your messages
(https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009520.html)
proposing a version 0 or even a >1MB block in the specific case of a
block size limit hard fork. I can see the >1MB flag block creating DoS
banning problems. That's more of a practical issue than a consensus
issue due to the existing mono-culture of full nodes. So, currently a
>1MB flag block is not as appealing as a version 0 or this hard fork
bit proposal. Besides the DoS ban, the >1MB proposal would mean that
older nodes do not have the chance to notice a fork is happening (for
alerting) as they would with a version 0 or hard fork bit.

A version 0 flag block would not be able to contain any transactions
unless the flag block version was assumed to be that of the most
recent version at the time. This is because we'd want to enforce the
rules of the previous soft forks that had been locked in. Other than
that, the version 0 idea seems pretty similar to the hard fork bit
proposal because you need more context than just the block itself to
determine if it's a valid flag block (and this extra context is
probably not great, but I don't have a better idea right now).

Were those reasons part of why you progressed towards this hard fork
bit proposal?

Although the chance is very slim, it is possible to have multiple 
hardforks sharing the same flag block. For example, different proposals 
may decide the flag time based on voting result and 2 proposals may have 
the same flag time just by chance. The coinbase message is to preclude 
any potential ambiguity. It also provides additional info to warning 
system of non-upgrading nodes.

If we are pretty sure that there won't be other hardfork proposal at the 
same time, the coinbase message may not be necessary. With some prior 
collaboration, this may also be avoided (e.g. no sharing flag block 
allowed as consensus rules of the hardforks)

The "version 0" idea is not compatible with the version bits voting 
system, so I have this hardfork bit BIP after thinking more carefully. 
Otherwise they are technically similar.

Message-ID: <55BD2A7C.9060504@juno.com>

Regarding the block size increase, at least conceptually it seems to me 
there should be an easy solution. If we look at what works well with 
bitcoin, for example the block reward halving and difficulty regimes 
which due to their step function nature both contribute to the stability 
and predictability of the bitcoin universe while still allowing for the 
necessary dynamic adjustments. It seems to me there should be a 
corresponding and equally simple solution for the maximum block size.

I've never quite understood the supposed rationale behind the proposals 
for a new static maximum of 20 MB or 8 MB or 2 MB other than it would be 
trivial to implement. Why not come up with an equally simple, 
predictable dynamic function consistent with what is already proven to 
work in the bitcoin universe that would both preserve the scarcity of 
transaction capacity to encourage a fee market but also allow for more 
transactions when needed.

For example how about something like once every month at month-end, take 
the 6-month average non-zero transaction fee block size and multiply by 1.5?

With the # of transactions increasing then plateauing you arrive at a 
constant excess capacity of around 33%:

MO    ABS    MBS    EX CAP
1    750    1000    25.0%
2    775    1000    22.5%
3    800    1000    20.0%
4    825    1000    17.5%
5    850    1000    15.0%
6    875    1219    28.2%
7    900    1256    28.4%
8    925    1294    28.5%
9    950    1331    28.6%
10    975    1369    28.8%
11    1000    1406    28.9%
12    1000    1438    30.4%
13    1000    1463    31.6%
14    1000    1481    32.5%
15    1000    1494    33.1%
16    1000    1500    33.3%
17    1000    1500    33.3%
18    1000    1500    33.3%

Similarly, in a declining then plateauing # of transactions market you 
also arrive at a constant excess capacity of about 33%

MO    ABS    MBS    EX CAP
1    750    1000    25.0%
2    725    1000    27.5%
3    700    1000    30.0%
4    675    1000    32.5%
5    650    1000    35.0%
6    625    1031    39.4%
7    600    994    39.6%
8    575    956    39.9%
9    550    919    40.1%
10    525    881    40.4%
11    500    844    40.7%
12    500    813    38.5%
13    500    788    36.5%
14    500    769    35.0%
15    500    756    33.9%
16    500    750    33.3%
17    500    750    33.3%
18    500    750    33.3%

With some simple statistical analysis, one could easily arrive at a 
statistically-inferred excess capacity linked the to probability of 
transaction volume exceeding the new cap in any forward monthly 
interval. In the tables above, I have used my own intuition that people 
seem to be generally comfortable with excess capacity of >= 33% and 
become less so at < 33%.

A scheme like this would have multiple benefits:

1) Adapts predictably and automatically to both rising and declining 
market demand for transactions

2) Preserves the fee market with a constant target excess capacity

3) Monthly adjustment interval and six month lookback allow for 
sufficient time to plan for changes in system capacity

In the case where transaction volume spikes such that it exceeds the 
monthly limit, the fee market would then take over to ensure high 
priority transactions get through fastest. In the case of malicious 
activity, such an attack would have to be maintained for well over a 
month to significantly adversely affect the maximum block size. As long 
as there is a non-zero cost to such attacks, the likelihood of 
maintaining one for a period of months decreases significantly.

This is fine, I think. I believe we shouldn't proceed with a hardfork
without having reasonable expectation that it will be deployed by everyone

Given the time recent softforks have taken to deploy, I think that's too
soon.

2016-01-12 00:00 UTC is Monday evening in US and Tuesday morning in China.

I have considered suggesting a faster ramp-up in the beginning, but I don't
think there is indisputable evidence that we can currently deal with
significantly larger blocks. I don't think "painful" is the right criterion
either; I'm sure my equipment can "handle" 20 MB blocks too, but with a
huge impact on network propagation speed, and even more people choosing the
outsource their full nodes.

Regarding "reasonable", I have a theory. What if we would have had 8 MB
blocks from the start? My guess is that some more people would have decided
to run their high-transaction-rate use cases on chain, that we'd regularly
see 4-6 MB blocks, there would be more complaints about low full node
counts, maybe 90% instead of 60% of the hash rate would be have SPV mining
agreements with each other, we'd somehow have accepted that even worse
reality, but people would still be complaining about the measly 25
transactions per second that Bitcoin could handle on-chain, and be
demanding a faster rampup to a more "reasonable" 64 MB block size as well.

I know many technologies have had faster growth, but I believe that global
bandwidth accessibility is the bottleneck, so the growth rate in my
proposal is based on that.

I'd rather be conservative here. My primary purpose is trying to create an
uncontroversial proposal that introduces an expectation of growth with
technology.

I disagree with the notion of "needed". The blockchain provides utility at
every size, and perhaps more at some sizes than at other sizes, but any
finite size will permit some use cases and not others. This is already the
case and will remain the case. I think the "demand for payments" should be
considered infinite, and some of them will fit on a block chain and pay a
fee for it, and others will need to rely on more efficient, cheaper, but
higher trust systems. You can't use observed usage as a metric for demand
without fixing the cost.

I think available space should grow with technology, to keep the relative
costs to the ecosystem for maintaining a decentralized system constant.
That may or may not lead to a fee market, but I don't think the fee market
is a goal - only a healthy outcome. The goal is an ecosystem that accepts
that the limit to scalability is set by the requirements of a decentralized
system, and its demand - and certainly not perceived demand at potentially
near-zero fee/cost - can't change that.

That's trivially gamable by miners, by filling the blocks with their own
transactions.

You've proposed scaling the cap based on technology growth.  There's
still a cap to stop bad things from happening.

Once that is done, why worry so much about whether the uses are
efficient?  Let people work in the space created.  Let them figure out
how to make good things happen in the application space.

Since I'm using "30 days after 75% miner support", the actual deployment 
period will be longer than 30 days. Anyway, if all major exchanges and 
merchants agree to upgrade, people are forced to upgrade immediately or 
they will follow a worthless chain.

Since the block reward is miners' major income source, no rational miner 
would create mega blocks unless the fee could cover the extra orphaning 
risk. Blocks were not constantly full until recent months, and many 
miners are still keeping the 750kB soft limit. This strongly suggests 
that we won't have 4MB blocks now even Satoshi set a 8MB limit.

I don't have the data now but I believe the Satoshi Dice model failed 
not primarily due to the 1MB cap, but the raise in BTC/USD rate. Since 
minting reward is a fixed value in BTC, the tx fee must also be valued 
in BTC as it is primarily for compensating the extra orphaning risk. As 
the BTC/USD rate increases, the tx fee measured in USD would also 
increase, making micro-payment (measured in USD) unsustainable.

We might have less full nodes, but it was Satoshi's original plan: "At 
first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows 
beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists 
with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need 
to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node." Theoretically, we only require one honest full node to 
prove wrongdoing on the blockchain and tell every SPV nodes to blacklist 
the invalid chain.

I think SPV mining exists long before the 1MB block became full, and I 
don't think we could stop this trend by artificially suppressing the 
block size. Miners should just do it properly, e.g. stop mining until 
the grandparent block is verified, which would make sure an invalid fork 
won't grow beyond 2 blocks.

If we could have a longer initial ramp up period, we may adopt a slower 
long term parameter. I think we should at least restore the original 
32MB limit in a reasonable time frame, say 6-8 years, instead of 20 
years in your proposal. If you believe Bitcoin should become a global 
settlement network, 32MB would be the very minimum as that is only 75% 
of current SWIFT traffic.

Hash: SHA1

I am in favor of a more gradual (longer) period and a softforking
solution... that is, more than 30 days of grace period (some period
between 60 days and a year), ...

... and given the number of valid softforking proposals out there it
seems to me that it would be rather simple to see one or more (e.g.
Cameron Garnham's dynamic block size adjustment (needing soft fork
only)) in a BIP.

It is also worthwhile to add that some of the softforking proposals,
and I believe Garnham's to be one of them, are not incompatible with
proposals such as Jeff Garzik's BIP 100, that is to say, there is
nothing keeping you from doing the Garnham dynamic block size
adjustment (softfork) right now today, examining its progress and
effect, while also preparing for a Garzik (BIP 100) for example.

If we don't want it to go fast, why let them? A hardfork is a means for the

I disagree. I think "demand" is strongly influenced by the knowledge of
space that looks available. If you look at historic block sizes, you see it
follows a series of block functions, not nice organic growth. My theory is
that this is changed defaults in software, new services appearing suddenly,
and people reacting to it. Demand fills the available space.

Also, SPV mining has nearly zero orphaning risk, only brief chance of loss
of fees as income.

> I don't have the data now but I believe the Satoshi Dice model failed not
primarily due to the 1MB cap, but the raise in BTC/USD rate. Since minting
reward is a fixed value in BTC, the tx fee must also be valued in BTC as it
is primarily for compensating the extra orphaning risk. As the BTC/USD rate
increases, the tx fee measured in USD would also increase, making
micro-payment (measured in USD) unsustainable.

I agree, but how does that matter? I don't think high fees and full blocks
should be the goal, but I think it would be a healthier outcome than what
we have now.

> We might have less full nodes, but it was Satoshi's original plan: "At
first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond
a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server
farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one
node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node."
Theoretically, we only require one honest full node to prove wrongdoing on
the blockchain and tell every SPV nodes to blacklist the invalid chain.

Theoretically, we also only need one central bank, then? Sorry, if the
outcome is one (or just a few) entities that keep the system in check, I
think it loses any benefit it has over other systems, while still keeping
its costs and disadvantages (confirmation speed, mining infrastructure,
subsidy...).

I know that 8 MB blocks do not immediately mean such a dramatic outcome.
But I do believe that as a community setting the block size based on
observed demand (which you do by saying "8 is a more reasonable size than
2" as argument) is the wrong way. What do you do when your 8 MB starts to
look "full", before your schedule says it can increase?

The block size and its costs - bandwidth, processing, centralization
effects for miners, ... - are the things that should be constrained. Demand
will fill it.

> I think SPV mining exists long before the 1MB block became full, and I
don't think we could stop this trend by artificially suppressing the block
size. Miners should just do it properly, e.g. stop mining until the
grandparent block is verified, which would make sure an invalid fork won't
grow beyond 2 blocks.

That would be a huge reduction in security as a mechanism itself, and even
worse due to needing to trust miners to follow that protocol. Without
proper incentives, miners become a trusted party, and due to needed SPV
mining agreements, potentially a closed group too. That is not an
interesting future.

> If you believe Bitcoin should become a global settlement network, 32MB
would be the very minimum as that is only 75% of current SWIFT traffic.

See my BIP text about advantages of Bitcoin, please. A future where it has
to compete with the existing system - using that system's own strengths -
is not interesting.

I think your "hardfork bit" proposal is clever.
It addresses the particular valid concern of re-org facing users of a
fork that a small/near/fluctuating majority, or less, of mining power
supported.
While the "economic majority" argument may be enough on its own in
that case, it still has some aspect of being a hand wave.
This proposal adds support to those economic actors, which makes it
easier for them to switch if/when they choose. That is, it provides a
good fallback mechanism that allows them to make a decision and say,
"we're doing this".
Do you have the latest version up on github, or someplace where it
would be easier to collaborate on the specific text?

China is a communist country. It is no secret that all "capitalist"
enterprises are essentially State controlled, or at the very least are
subject to nationalization should the State deem it necessary. Most ASIC
chips are manufactured in China, so they are cheap and accessible to
Chinese miners. Electricity is subsidized and essentially free. Cooling is
not an issue since large parts of China are mountainous and naturally cool.
In short the Chinese miners have HUGE advantages over all other mining
operations. This is probably why, between just the top 4 Chinese miners,
the People's Republic of China effectively controls 57% of all the Bitcoin
being mined.

The ONLY disadvantage the Chinese miners have in competing with the rest of
the world is bandwidth. China has poor connectivity with the rest of the
world, and Chinese miners have said that an increase in the block size
would be detrimental to them. I say, GOOD! Most of the free world has
enough bandwidth to be able to handle larger blocks. We need to take
advantage of that fact to get mining out of the centralized control of the
Chinese.

If you're truly worried about larger blocks causing centralization, think
about how, by restricting blocksize, you're enabling the Communist Chinese
government to maintain centralized control over 57% of the Bitcoin hashing
power.

It will help to assume that there is at least one group of evil people who
are investing in Bitcon's demise.  Not because there are, but because there
might be.  So let's assume they are making a set of a billion transactions,
or a trillion, and maintaining currently-being-legitimately-used hashing
power.  When block size is large enough to frustrate other miners, this
hash power (or some piece of it) will be experimentally shifted to solving
a block containing an internally consistent subset of the prepared
trasnsactions to fill it - experimentally at first, but on the active
Bitcoin network.  One seemingly random, bloated, useless (except for the
universal timestamp) block will be created and the evil group will measure
the effect on the mining community - client takedowns, market exits, and
whatever else interests them.  Then they lie in wait, perhaps let out one
more to do another experiment, but with the goal of eventually catching us
unawares and doing as much damage to morale as possible.

Good concrete descriptions of the threats against which we want to guard
will be very helpful.  Maybe there are already unit tests for such things
or requests for miners' reactions to them (as opposed to just the
software's behavior).  My description might be a bit too long and perhaps
not a very good example, but do we have a place where such examples can be
constructed?

While we will do our best to guard against such nightmares, it's also
helpful to imagine what we will do if and when one of them ever actually
occurs.  Yes, I'm paranoid; because those who like to control everything
are losing it.

I haven't seen anyone do the (trivial) maths on this. Have I just
missed it? By my count:

 - blocks in 25 btc in rewards and about 0.5 btc in fees per block
 - at ~$300 USD per btc, that's ~$7,650 per block

 - current hashrate is ~400 PH/s; so ~240,000 PH/block works out
   to having to spend about 30PH per dollar earnt.
 - for comparison,
      https://products.butterflylabs.com/cloud-mining-contracts.html
    quotes $1.99 per GH/s for 12 months, which by my count is
      60*60*24*365 / 1.99 GH/$ = 15.8 PH per dollar spent
 - hashrate growth has slowed from about x4/quarter to x2/year:
     sep '13: ~1PH/s
     dec '13: ~4PH/s
     mar '14: ~20PH/s
     jun '14: ~80PH/s
     sep '14: ~200PH/s
     aug '15: ~400PH/s

 - so, as far as I understand it, miners don't make absurd profits compared
   to capital investment and running costs
 - presumably, then, miners will stop mining bitcoin if the revenue/block
   drops significantly at some point
 - less miners means a lower hashrate; a lower hashrate makes
   50% attacks easier, and that's a bad thing (especially if there's lots
   of pre-loved ASIC mining hardware available cheap on ebay or alibaba)

 - in about a year, the block reward halves, cutting out 12.5 btc or
   ~$3750 USD per block. without an increase in fees per block, miners
   will just get ~$3900 USD per block
 - the last time the reward for mining a block was under $4000 per block
   was around oct '13, with a hashrate of ~2PH/s

 - 13 btc in fees per block compared to .5 btc in fees per block is a
   25x increase; which could be either an increase in fee/txn or
   txns/block
 - with ~500 bytes/transaction, that's ~2000 transactions per MB
 - 13 btc in fees ($3900) per block means per transaction fees of
   about
     $2 for 1MB blocks
     $1 for 2MB blocks
     25c for 8MB blocks
     10c for 20MB blocks
   (assuming full blocks, 500 byte txns)

 - comparing that to credit card or paypal fees at ~2.5% that's:
    $2 -> minimum transaction  $80
    $1 -> minimum transaction  $40
    25c -> minimum transaction $10
    10c -> minimum transaction  $4

 - those numbers only depend on the USD/BTC exchange rate in so far as
   the more USD for a BTC, the more likely the block reward will pay
   for hashrate without transaction fees, even with the reward reduced
   to 12.5 btc/block. otherwise it's just USD/txn paying for USD/hashrate

 - the reference implementation fee of 0.1mBTC/kB equates to about
   3c per transaction (since it rounds up). Even 10c/transaction is more
   than a 3x increase on that.

What the above says to me is that even assuming everyone starts paying
fees, the lightning network works great, and so do sidechains and whatever
else, you /still/ want to up the volume of bitcoin txns by something like
an order of magnitude above what's currently allowed within a year or so.

Dear Jim,

Thank you for sharing your view w.r.t. the so called 'Chinese Miners'.

Diversity of opinion, and mining, are IMHO both good and it's indeed a
free world.... so others who wish to mine bitcoin should be encouraged  to
make the capital and technical investments to do so.

May I ask what is your technical suggestion to move this discussion forward
beyond your anti-Chinese/anti-China rhetoric?   e.g. I would be
particularly grateful if you could share your  views w.r.t. colluding miner
attacks in draft 0.5.9. of Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja's 'Lightning
network' paper, found here:-

http://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf

Respectfully,

p.

Jim, some good points... People are rightly concerned about any given
regional or nation-state's dominance in mining, but China has
certainly become more of a subject of concern as of late, and not
simply because it is a communist country and because its economy is
highly centralized and state-run, but rather, because of the advent of
newly proposed or adopted laws (not unlike those which we see being
proposed in the UK or those recently adopted in France, so that no-one
may say I am unfairly targeting China).  Further, the recent shots off
the bow between the USA and China in the latest crypto-wars saga
(whether bluster or ultimately not) mean that we should be seriously
concerned about too much mining happening in one specific region; thus
there shouldn't be too much incentive for that to happen, yet at the
time being (as you've rightly pointed out) the subsidization of
electricity there, combined with the availability of certain
environmental conditions for cooling and / or hydropower, means that
China dominates the mining realm.

Recently I took the time to ask someone associated with a new bitcoin
mining operation in China some questions about the new (apparently
developing) National Security Law of China.

According to an early draft of this National Security Law, "the State
maintains the basic economic system and order of the socialist
marketplace ... safeguarding security in important industries and
fields that influence the populace's economic livelihood ... as well
as other major economic interests."

The Chinese government is currently reviewing another national
security related law, which in its first draft would mandate ALL
Internet companies operating in China to provide backdoor access and
encryption keys to the government.  (One would imagine that would
include any exchanges and mining operations as well.)

The US FBI Director (Comey) has also, of course, made plenty of
arguments for backdoors in encryption.  But as security expert Bruce
Schneier points out, there "really is no way" to keep users' data safe
while providing backdoors. He said:

    "I have two options. I can design a secure system that has no
backdoor access, meaning neither criminals nor foreign intelligence
agencies nor domestic police can get at the data. Or I can design a
system that has backdoor access, meaning they all can."
(Reference:
http://www.zdnet.com/article/because-there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-secure-
backdoor-gosh-darn-it/
)

Anyway, the response of the individual (eric at haobtc - of haobtc.com)
to my questions can be seen here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1072474.msg11914077#msg11914077

His responses were provided to me before the recent "Crypto Wars"
announcements which I think will only think make things worse:

https://twitter.com/helios_unbound/status/627648646985719809

So, I try to be optimistic, but I'm leaning pessimistic right now
about the situation with the effect of the Crypto Wars combined with
the dominance of Chinese mining plus China's development of new laws
that seem to involve further attempts to backdoor hardware and / or
software.  Obviously this doesn't break bitcoin for mathematical
reasons that everyone on this list is already familiar with I'm sure,
but it is concerning to me, and now I will /endrant

I realize that my argument may have come across as anti-Chinese, but I can
assure you that my concerns are not nationalist or racist in nature, so I
apologize if they came across as such. I was raised under another
oppressive regime, the US government, so I am sympathetic to the problems
of the Chinese people.

I am in fact only concerned with the very real fact that a majority of the
Bitcoin network's hashing power is centralized within the political borders
of one country and consequently the entire Bitcoin economy is at risk of
political manipulation. I have seen frequent instances within my own
homeland where the government has seized control over private businesses
through draconian regulation. I have witnessed in other countries where
businesses are seized and nationalized more directly. I am concerned that
the Chinese government might decide to nationalize the Bitcoin mines within
its borders, and what they might do with 57% of the network hashing power.

If it were any other country I would be equally concerned. But it's not any
other country. It's China. And I don't trust the Chinese government any
more than I trust any other government not to take actions that might harm
Bitcoin.

If block-sizes are increased in a way detrimental to the Chinese miners, it
is not the Chinese miners that lose, it is all of the non-Chinese miners -
this is because the Chinese miners have the slight majority of the
hashrate.  The relatively low external bandwidth connecting China to the
net is actually the problem of the non-Chinese miners problem.  Non Chinese
miners will experience higher orphan rate once Chinese miners cease to
build on top of blocks that are too large to sync in a timely fashion into
China.

Yes I've had a couple other people point that out to me as well and the
logic is sound. Unfortunately that doesn't help solve the actual issue that
mining is currently consolidated within the jurisdiction of a single
political body that is not exactly Bitcoin friendly. I don't know how to
solve that issue aside from pointing it out and hoping miners outside of
China point to different pools and build more farms in smaller countries.
Venezuela for example has cheap electricity and could be a good place to
mine. Iceland too.

Increasing the block size shouldn't be a problem for Chinese miners.
Five of the largest - F2Pool, Antpool, BW, BTCChina, Huobi - have
already signed a draft agreement indicating they are fine with an
increase to 8 MB: http://www.8btc.com/blocksize-increase-2

With regards to China's international bandwidth, not only is intra-Asia
capacity improving all the time, a major consortium cable FASTER is
coming online Q2 2016.  Backed by Google, China Telecom and others, it
has a capacity of 60 Tbps, making it the highest-capacity data link ever
created across the Pacific.

What's the current stance of the Chinese pools on Bitcoin XT, should
Bitcoin Core refuse to increase the block size to 8 MB in a timely fashion?
Would they run it if the economic majority (e.g. Coinbase, Bitpay, etc.)
publicly stated their support for big blocks?

There are two problems with this statement.  Firstly we can not be doing
protocol design via political lobbying - this is not a scientific approach
and for sure leads to disaster; it is not the colour of the paint on the box,
it is the security of the system.

Secondly as I understand it the Chinese miners did this under duress
of threats of worse as a compromise beyond what they felt they could safely
cope with.

That is good news.

Again this should not be a political or business compromise model - we
must focus on scientific evaluation, technical requirements and
security.

But specifically as you asked a group of Chinese miners said they
would not run it:

http://cointelegraph.com/news/114657/chinese-mining-pools-call-for-consensus-refuse-switch-to-bitcoin-xt

Imagine if we had a nuclear reactor design criteria - we would not be
asking around with companies what parameter would they compromise on.
We'd be looking to scientific analysis of what is safe, based on
empirical and theoretical work on safety.  If we're risking $4b of
other peoples money (and a little bit of mine) I would strongly want a
scientific approach.

A closer analogy would be the NIST SHA3 design process.  With crypto
building blocks it is a security / speed tradeoff, a little analogous
to the security / throughput trade off in Bitcoin.

They do not ask companies or governments which algorithm they like or
what parameter they'd compromise on.  They have a design competition
and analyse the algorithms and parameters for security margin and
speed optimisation in hardware and software.  Much effort is put in
and it is very rigorous because a lot is at stake if they get it
wrong.

I will assert that the block size is political because it affects nearly
all users to some degree and not all those users are technically inclined
or care to keep decentralisation in the current configuration as you do.
This debate has forgotten the current and future users of Bitcoin. Most of
them think the hit to node count in the short term preferable to making it
expensive and competitive to transact.

We all need a little faith that the system will reorganise and readjust
after the move to big blocks in a way that still has a reasonable degree of
decentralisation and trustlessness. The incentives of Bitcoin remain, so
everyone's decentralised decision throughout the system, from miners,
merchants and users, will continue to act according to those incentives.

There have already been two notable incidents requiring manual intervention and good-faith cooperation between core devs and mining pool operators that would have either never gotten resolved alone or would have ended up costing a lot of people a lot of money had no action been taken (March 2013 and July 2015). They were both caused by consensus disagreement that directly or indirectly were brought about by bigger blocks. There is *strong* evidence?and a great deal of theory explaining it?that links larger blocks with the propensity for consensus forks that require manual intervention.

Please, can we stop saying this is merely about decentralization and trustlessness? The very model upon which the security of the system is based *broke*?as in, we were only able to recover because a few individuals deliberately manipulated the consensus rules to fix it manually. Shouldn?t we more highly prioritize fixing the issues that can lead to these incidents than trying to increase throughput? Increasing block size cannot possibly make these forking tendencies better?but it very well could make them worse.

What's wrong with a little cooperation to resolve things now and then? Man
is not an island unto himself, we compete with each other and we cooperate
with each other occasionally if it's mutually beneficial.

You said yourself that a lot of money would have been lost if the two hard
forks cited weren't resolved - that's the correct incentives at work again.

Bah, I don?t know if you?re just trolling me, Hector?but I?ll give you the benefit of the doubt and act like you aren?t.

We already have much more efficient, far more scalable systems that allow this kind of cooperation you speak of without the inconveniences of blockchains and such. These incidents do, fortunately, present some of the better sides of humanity?but?the design of the network *broke* - and for reasons that are now well understood to be only worsened by larger blocks. These incidents are *not supposed to happen* - and if they do, it means we?ve botched something up and need to fix it. And by fix it, I mean fix the protocol so that given our best understanding of things in the present we can significantly reduce the potential for its occurrence in the future.

The correct incentives here were not due to people potentially losing a lot of money. The incentives here were well-intentioned altruism. Some miners lost money as a result of these actions?and they didn?t put up a fight. if you want to design a system around the assumption that this is how all such incidents will be resolved, please don?t spoil this for the rest of us.

There is a degree of difference between cooperation in day-to-day usage of
the system and cooperation in the rare cases the system has a bug.

Distribution by consensus is inherently a fragile system. The network will
continue to break again and again as long as programmers are fallible. But
the types of bugs that occur will change over time as we learn the best
practices for maintaining the system.

Altruism is a facade that hides other motivations. The party cooperating
with the miners losing money were doing so to maintain good relationships
with those miners and to make sure those miners stay within the system and
not attack it.

I have put it on the github: 
https://github.com/jl2012/bips/blob/master/hardforkbit.mediawiki

I removed the specification of coinbase message to make it simpler. 
Instead, it requires that a flag block must not be shared by multiple 
hardfork proposals.

I'm not sure whether it is a Standard, Informational, or Process BIP

I'm also thinking whether we should call it "hardfork bit", "hardfork 
flag", or with other name.

If it?s an as-of-yet unidentified issue that comes up, yes?obviously we can?t plan for everything and we?ll make some mistakes. But here we?re talking about specific well-known issues (or at least well-known today) for which several people have proposed potential solutions. However, these things have been all but ignored in the public discourse.

And by fix it, I mean fix the protocol so that given our best understanding of things in the present we can significantly reduce the potential for its occurrence in the future.

I agree. But again, once we?ve identified specific issues, it is irresponsible to continue to pretend they don?t exist?and to more highly prioritize changes that can only make the problem worse.

Again, for the record, I am not against ultimately allowing bigger blocks. I think it would be a good thing to be able to do this?and my main concerns are not around things like equipment costs or typical household bandwidth. I just think security is a more important feature than greater throughput and prioritize it thusly.

I don?t disagree?clearly even the miners that lost money believed that consensus was more valuable to them than a few bitcoins. However, it seems to be EXTREMELY dangerous to assume that it will always work out this way. What?s to stop a mining majority from deciding on-the-fly they want to keep a particular consensus rule that benefits them even if the core developers disagree?

Security is an ongoing incremental process and everyone is giving it the
highest priority. Forgive me for being a bit behind on this - are you able
to point me to the potential solutions for the problems that were
identified from the unintentional hard forks?

The users of Bitcoin are living in a free world. Bitcoin like many
political systems requires the cooperation of the majority. If a majority
of miners decide to change the rules to benefit only themselves then the
system will quickly lead to collapse, until a new system arising from the
ashes of the previous one is erected.

In fact the situation is more optimistic than this. Miners don't set the
rules, the economic majority does. The miners must follow the rules that
are acceptable by the economic majority, or quickly go out of business.

Does that not sound like a useful check-and-balance? It does to me.

In a scenario where these network limitations and miner rate
distributions are the same to begin, and the block and transaction
size limits are raised or removed, your observation would seem to
indicate that blocks that are outstandingly large would not be mined
often or at all (due to orphan risk), until at least the network
limitations or rate distributions changed.

Such a scenario could shape up to be a non-event. Miner majority could
choose to not change their policy regarding effective block and
transaction sizes (which includes both the size of the blocks they
create and the size of the blocks that they choose to build upon). To
make it not a total non-event, then the miners might update their
policy to increase the effective sizes a measured amount. They
wouldn't want to go too far because of the risk of spooking the
economic majority, or because of their own technological limitations
(which I'm supposing would remain transport layer limitations).

To me, in absence of these transport layer limitations that have crept
up into the consensus rules layer (clear layer violations), it seems
that one thing that would otherwise naturally bound the upper and
lower limits of effective block and transaction size is the economic
majority feedback loop to miners. Get too far out of line and the
effect on usefulness, or properties of the system, will make people
react by lowering the purchasing power of the block rewards. For
example, attack other miners to drive more mining centralization, or
create blocks that are currently too big for people to validate/use,
and that feedback loop will start to direct negatively.

Why do miners not currently choose policy that favors smaller blocks
and transactions than they do? Laziness/indifference only explains so
much. I submit that they don't because if they make the system less
useful, then people will react by selling off coins and potentially
leaving the ecosystem (they might also just wait on the sidelines to
see if the system self-corrects). If the miners tested those waters,
and found out that they made a mistake, at least they would be free to
correct their actions (and quickly). Not all would be lost. Some value
could be (temporarily) lost. It could also be re-gained if the system
self-corrected.

To follow-up on the layer violation idea that I started on before, I
think a secondary, non-consensus rule layer, indication of what block
and transaction sizes are acceptable to the economic majority would be
found in the transport protocols that they use. For example, the
effective P2P protocol limit that is 2MB or 32MB (depending on version
of the Core client) would be one such indication. Doesn't anyone think
that separating the consensus layer rules from the transport layer
supporting it should be a goal?

Message-ID: <CABsx9T1E1s=4h-SxLTOAXK4GniZrUekcEb6zDdTDFG+h7X98MA@mail.gmail.com>

I haven't seen this excellent recent blog post by Eli Dourado referenced
here:
  https://readplaintext.com/how-should-bitcoin-be-governed-680192fcd92b

I agree with his conclusions: we need better communication/organization
mechanisms among 'stakeholders' and between the various factions
(developers, miners, merchants, exchanges, end-users).

And the preliminary results of using a prediction market to try to wrestle
with the tough tradeoffs looks roughly correct to me, too:
   https://blocksizedebate.com/

(my only big disagreement with those predictions is the 'Number of nodes'
-- I don't think replace-by-fee would affect that number, and I think even
with no change we will see the number of full nodes on the network drop to
a couple thousand, because the general-purpose-home-PC is headed the way of
the dodo:

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Incentivising full nodes by having SPV nodes to pay
 for data requests
In-Reply-To: <BLU172-W18766B61EF807ACC5F3DBCC2770@phx.gbl>
References: <BLU172-W18766B61EF807ACC5F3DBCC2770@phx.gbl>
Message-ID: <BLU172-W348AAB2648B8D7D323A68DC2770@phx.gbl>

The current block size debate has brought up an important, albeit often neglected observation. Full nodes suffer from a tragedy of the commons problem and therefore are likely to continue decreasing as a percentage of total Bitcoin nodes. This also results in a vicious circle as more and more people use SPVs, the burden on existing full nodes will increase even without a block size increase, which will further reduce the number of full nodes . A few people have mentioned it in blogs or reddit, but the topic is generally quickly overshadowed by posts along the lines of  "RAISE the blocksize already!".
Full nodes bear the full cost of validating/relaying/storing the blockchain and servicing SPV clients but gain nothing financially from it, yet they serve an important role in validating transactions and keeping miner dishonesty in check. If there were few independent full nodes, it would be possible for 3-4 of the biggest mining pools to collude and do literally whatever they wanted with the protocol, including inflating the money supply, freezing funds or even confiscating funds, because who would know? And even if someone running a full node did voice out, the majority of users on SPV/Coinbase/etc.. would be powerless to do anything about it and would likely bear with the changes to protect status quo, just as is the case with current fiat regimes where people bear with QE/Inflation/bail outs because they are so dependent on the current system that they would rather tolerate any injustice than to have the system go down and bring them with it. This is the primary reason why many in the technical community are against drastic blocksize increases, as this will only worsen the problem of decentralization as this cost increases. And as long as full nodes are running on charity, i'm fully in agreement with the conservative block size camp. 
However, it is important to note that this seems to be an economic problem instead of a technical one. I cannot deny the argument from the big block side that technically, the hardware/bandwidth required to run full nodes supporting considerably larger blocks (4MB-8MB) is not out of reach of many individuals around the globe. The core issue in my opinion is that of incentive, because at the end of the day, running a full node is not free and at larger blocks costs will not be trivial. In my opinion, its perhaps our insistence that full nodes cant be incentivised that contributes to centralization pressures and discourages increasing of blocksize even though the technology exists to support it.
Technically, existing hardware is capable of validating/processing blocks in the region of an order of magnitude larger than the current limit. Bandwidth requirements for running a validating full node are also not very high if you are not mining, as you can afford to wait a couple of minutes to download your block. This is obviously not the case for miners who need to download new blocks asap to avoid idle hash power or as has been seen in the recent fork, SPV mining (which is extremely undesirable for the network). IBLT should help greatly in reducing the propagation time of new blocks and ease peak bandwidth requirements. But im not worried about the miners, they are after all being financially compensated for what they are doing and investing in more bandwidth(either locally or running a full node remotely) can be seen as a cost of the business as long as the cost of running a full node is insignificant to the cost of hashing equipment to keep barriers to mining low. 

Before the concept lightning, there did not seem to be any trustless way of feasibly paying small micropayments to full nodes for their services. However, with payment channels and lightning, this may no longer be an issue. A node could advertise it's rates to a SPV nodes upon connection and the SPV could either agree or look for another node with lower fees. If implemented, fees are likely to be trivial(few satoshis per request) as competition will drive down fees close to the cost of running a full node. This should spur an increase in the number of full nodes and increase decentralization of the network.
I just wanted to float the idea and hear comments/feedback/critiques of this idea.

I proposed something along these lines in the lightning-dev mailing list:
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-July/000088.html

It's probably a little off-topic there...but I'm very interested in
discussing such ideas.

The typical interpretation of the "tragedy of the commons" scenario is
based on the presumption that a limited resource is controlled by the state.

In a free market there is no such idea, a limited resource becomes
property and is therefore allocated by customer preference and
maintained by self-interest.

Validation is not a resource controlled by the state, which is of course
the point of Bitcoin.

It is inaccurate to think of Bitcoin validation a limited resource. The
scenario in which fewer people validate does not reduce the amount of
validation available. It increases the risk of loss to those who fail to
validate. The gain to those who do validate comes from avoiding that loss.

The point is that without concrete direct incentives, many might find it
rational to just leech off others...which might actually work for a
while...but this is obviously not stable equilibrium...and it's very hard
to do any game theory on it.

Current SPV implementations necessarily diverge from the p2p model and
strongly tend toward a client/server architecture. It was originally
thought that mining would provide an incentive to run servers...but we all
know that's not at all how things have turned out.

Using offchain protocols with blockchain settlement guarantees, it is
possible for clients to request proofs directly from servers without
requiring any additional authentication layers...and can perhaps even be
onion-routed to hide the client's identity.

Checking SPV proofs is cheap...it only requires downloading headers,
checking PoW, and constructing a lookup table mapping block hashes to
merkle roots. This structure can easily be stored entirely in RAM on
typical consumer devices (it's at most 80 bytes per block, or a little over
30MB right now and grows at a very manageable rate). The most expensive
step to prove inclusion of a specific transaction in the blockchain is then
O(log n) sha256 operations, where n is the number of transactions in the
block.

Using p2sh, we ensure the txout script is a mere 22 bytes. Full validation
nodes can fully prune the partial merkle tree structure when the output is
spent. SPV proof serving nodes would still need to store full blocks...but
as long as they are getting paid for this market forces could lead to a
stable balance between clients and servers...or at least adaptive dynamics
that prevent deficits or surpluses.

If I screwed something up in this analysis someone please correct me.

No, I think one of the fundamental problems with the Foundation is it tries
to represent everybody's interests. The interests of exchanges are not
necessarily the same as end-users or miners, for example.

But it would make sense for exchanges (for example) to get together and
come to consensus on whatever issues are important to them, like the recent
consensus and then statement from "the Chinese miners" regarding the block
size issue.

Dear Bitcoin-Dev Mailing list,

I?d like to share a research paper I?ve recently completed titled ?A Transaction Fee Market Exists Without a Block Size Limit.?  In addition to presenting some useful charts such as the cost to produce large spam blocks, I think the paper convincingly demonstrates that, due to the orphaning cost, a block size limit is not necessary to ensure a functioning fee market.  

The paper does not argue that a block size limit is unnecessary in general, and in fact brings up questions related to mining cartels and the size of the UTXO set.   

It can be downloaded in PDF format here:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf

Or viewed with a web-browser here:

https://www.scribd.com/doc/273443462/A-Transaction-Fee-Market-Exists-Without-a-Block-Size-Limit

Abstract.  This paper shows how a rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node?s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit. To show this, the paper introduces the block space supply curve and the mempool demand curve.  The former describes the cost for a miner to supply block space by accounting for orphaning risk.  The latter represents the fees offered by the transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim a given portion of the fees.  The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the miner?s profit.  The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market?where miners are incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks?cannot exist since it requires communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate.  The paper concludes by considering the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and by estimating the cost of a spam attack.  

Best regards,
Peter

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Wrapping up the block size debate with voting
Message-ID: <1c808715eac12f67cf9865dfd97c0a37@xbt.hk>

As now we have some concrete proposals 
(https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009808.html), 
I think we should wrap up the endless debate with voting by different 
stakeholder groups.

---------------------------------
Candidate proposals

Candidate proposals must be complete BIPs with reference implementation 
which are ready to merge immediately. They must first go through the 
usual peer review process and get approved by the developers in a 
technical standpoint, without political or philosophical considerations. 
Any fine tune of a candidate proposal may not become an independent 
candidate, unless it introduces some ?real? difference. ?No change? is 
also one of the voting options.
---------------------------------
Voter groups

There will be several voter groups and their votes will be counted 
independently. (The time frames mentioned below are just for example.)

Miners: miners of blocks with timestamp between 1 to 30 Sept 2015 are 
eligible to vote. One block one vote. Miners will cast their votes by 
signing with the bitcoin address in coinbase. If there are multiple 
coinbase outputs, the vote is discounted by output value / total 
coinbase output value.
Many well-known pools are reusing addresses and they may not need to 
digitally sign their votes. In case there is any dispute, the digitally 
signed vote will be counted.

Bitcoin holders: People with bitcoin in the UTXO at block 372500 (around 
early September) are eligible to vote. The total ?balance? of each 
scriptPubKey is calculated and this is the weight of the vote. People 
will cast their votes by digital signature.
Special output types:
Multi-sig: vote must be signed according to the setting of the 
multi-sig.
P2SH: the serialized script must be provided
Publicly known private key: not eligible to vote
Non-standard script according to latest Bitcoin Core rules: not eligible 
to vote in general. May be judged case-by-case

Developers: People with certain amount of contribution in the past year 
in Bitcoin Core or other open sources wallet / alternative 
implementations. One person one vote.

Exchanges: Centralized exchanges listed on Coindesk Bitcoin Index, 
Winkdex, or NYSE Bitcoin index, with 30 days volume >100,000BTC are 
invited. This includes Bitfinex, BTC China, BitStamp, BTC-E, itBit, 
OKCoin, Huobi, Coinbase. Exchanges operated for at least 1 year with 
100,000BTC 30-day volume may also apply to be a voter in this category. 
One exchange one vote.

Merchants and service providers: This category includes all bitcoin 
accepting business that is not centralized fiat-currency exchange, e.g. 
virtual or physical stores, gambling sites, online wallet service, 
payment processors like Bitpay, decentralized exchange like 
Localbitcoin, ETF operators like Secondmarket Bitcoin Investment Trust. 
They must directly process bitcoin without relying on third party. They 
should process at least 100BTC in the last 30-days. One merchant one 
vote.

Full nodes operators: People operating full nodes for at least 168 hours 
(1 week) in July 2015 are eligible to vote, determined by the log of 
Bitnodes. Time is set in the past to avoid manipulation. One IP address 
one vote. Vote must be sent from the node?s IP address.

--------------------
Voting system

Single transferable vote is applied. 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote). Voters are 
required to rank their preference with ?1?, ?2?, ?3?, etc, or use ?N? to 
indicate rejection of a candidate.
Vote counting starts with every voter?s first choice. The candidate with 
fewest votes is eliminated and those votes are transferred according to 
their second choice. This process repeats until only one candidate is 
left, which is the most popular candidate. The result is presented as 
the approval rate: final votes for the most popular candidate / all 
valid votes

After the most popular candidate is determined, the whole counting 
process is repeated by eliminating this candidate, which will find the 
approval rate for the second most popular candidate. The process repeats 
until all proposals are ranked with the approval rate calculated.

--------------------
Interpretation of results:

It is possible that a candidate with lower ranking to have higher 
approval rate. However, ranking is more important than the approval 
rate, unless the difference in approval rate is really huge. 90% support 
would be excellent; 70% is good; 50% is marginal; <50% is failed.

--------------------
Technical issues:

Voting by the miners, developers, exchanges, and merchants are probably 
the easiest. We need a trusted person to verify the voters? identity by 
email, website, or digital signature. The trusted person will collect 
votes and publish the named votes so anyone could verify the results.

For full nodes, we need a trusted person to setup a website as an 
interface to vote. The votes with IP address will be published.

For bitcoin holders, the workload could be very high and we may need 
some automatic system to collect and count the votes. If people are 
worrying about reduced security due to exposed raw public key, they 
should move their bitcoin to a new address before voting.

Double voting: people are generally not allowed to change their mind 
after voting, especially for anonymous voters like bitcoin holders and 
solo miners. A double voting attempt from these classes will invalidate 
all related votes.

Multiple identity: People may have multiple roles in the Bitcoin 
ecology. I believe they should be allowed to vote in all applicable 
categories since they are contributing more than other people.

I would like to withdraw my proposal from your self-appointed vote.

If you want to let a majority decide about economic policy of a currency, I
suggest fiat currencies. They have been using this approach for quite a
while, I hear.

Bitcoin's consensus rules are a consensus system, not a democracy. Find a
solution that everyone agrees on, or don't.

What is your definition of "consensus"? Do you mean 100% agreement? 
Without a vote how do you know there is 100% (or whatever percentage) 
agreement?

> Find a solution that everyone agrees on, or don't.

Who are the "everyone"?

It is not scientific or sensible to go from proposal stage straight to
voting and then implementation stage.

The proposals you have diligently gathered, summarized and presented
in your document must go through testing, and scenario simulation with
published results, in order for objective evaluation to be made possible.

For that matter, even "running up against a capacity limit" has not
been simulated or tested. Additionally, (and looking the other way)
there is a lack of provision for scaling DOWN in the current proposals
- - hard to envision, yes - but what goes up will eventually come down.
A global credit contraction is not unlikely, nor is natural disaster,
and these scenarios have implications for usage, scale, degree of
decentralization and security.

CS is science, there is no reason for this generation not to apply
rigorous Computer Science to Bitcoin.

Nearly all the fiat currencies I'm familiar with have their economic policy
dictated by the government or the relevant central bank committee. Ordinary
users of the banking system are not consulted.

That's correct. The people who disagree will cease using the system, and
quite possibly move to a different one (i.e. Bitcoin XT). The people left
on the old system will indeed have a solution that they all can agree on.

As I mentioned, the candidate proposals must go through usual peer 
review process, which includes proper testing, I assume.

Scaling down is always possible with softforks, or miners will simply 
produce smaller blocks. BIP100 has a scaling down mechanism but it still 
requires miners to vote so it doesn't really make much difference

But anyway, this is off-topic, as candidate proposals may include 
mechanism for scaling down.

Instant runoff voting is not a good system for finding a consensus of the
voters.

http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/

The main issue here is the "Squeezing out" of center opinions.

If the middle option is acceptable to almost everyone but is only the top
choice of 20%, then it will lose in round one and leave only extreme
options remaining.

Approval is a better system for a consensus.

Each voter can indicate which of the proposals is approved/accepted and the
option with the most support wins.

If one option has 80% support and another has 90% support, then both make a
good choice (though the 90% one has won).

Range voting allows more accuracy, if that is an issue.  If voters are
honest, it allows a middle ground to be reached.

If everyone votes strategically, it becomes approval voting.  With
consensus, there is an assumption that a significant fraction of the
community would be willing to be honest rather than strategic.

The outcome is possible a final decision but not a binding decision.
Voters need to recognise that failing to find a middle ground could mean
they get their way but they split the community.

Additionally, since the point is to determine parameters, you don't
necessarily need to select from discrete candidates.

- Initial new size
- Rate of increase
- Maximum size

They are just numbers.  You could have votes indicate what they want, and
then use the median as the consensus option.

The exception is to have the miners choose what the size is (subject to
limits).  That option is already entirely in the hands of the miners and
they could do it unilaterally.

As explained by Venzen, this is a non-sequitur.

I don't know the answer either, that's fine. It's the opposite
question that I've been insistently repeating and you've been

But that's also fine because I believe you finally answer it a few lines below.

The emergence of a btc price enabled the emergence of professional
miners, which in turn enabled the emergence of sha256d-specialized
hardware production companies.
Nothing surprising there.
By no means it consitutes an example of how a bigger consensus sizes
can cause less mining centralization.

Correlation does not imply causation. I will better leave it at that...

No, I think 20 MB was chosen very optimistically, considering 3rd
party services rates (not the same service as self-hosting) in the
so-called "first world". And then 20 MB goes to 20 GB, again with
optimistic and by no means scientific expectations.

But where the number comes from it's not really what I'm demaning,
what I want is some criterion that can tell you that a given size
would be "too centralized" but another one isn't.
I haven't read any analysis on why 8GB is a better option than 7GB and
9GB for a given criterion (nor one declaring 20 GB a winner over 19 GB
or 21 GB).
A simulation test passing 20 GB but not 21 GB would make it far less arbitrary.

I'm of course talking about consensus maximum blocksize, not about
actual blocksize.
Yes, again, when mining becomes profitable, economic actors tend to
appear and get those profits.
But don't confuse total hashrate improvements with an "increase in the
number of miners" or with mining decentralization.

Finally, I think you finally answered my repetitive question here.
If I say "Mike Hearn understands that the consensus block size maximum
rule is a tool for limitting mining centralization" I'm not putting
words in your mouth, right?
I think many users advocating for an increase in the consensus limit
don't understand this, which is extremely unfortunate for the debate.

Great! Maybe after 2 mining centralization improves so much that we're
confortable not only not lowering it but rather increasing it.

Did the fact that you "understand that the consensus block size
maximum rule is a tool for limitting mining centralization" influenced
your rejection of that idea at all?

The only way that "not caring much whther we have a consensus limit or
not" and "understand that the consensus block size maximum rule is a
tool for limitting mining centralization" at the same time is by not
caring about mining centralization at all.
Is that your position?

If you don't care about having a limit but you don't want to limit
transaction volume, then ++current_size will ALWAYs be your
"compromise position" and no blocksize increase will ever be enough
until the limit is completely removed.
Is that your position?

Yes, and I believe the same points stand.

You keep talking about "high-value-transactions-only" like if
non-urgent transaction fees rising from zero to, say, 1 satoshi, would
automatically result in that "high-value-transactions-only" Bitcoin.
Please, stop talking as if someone was proposing a
"high-value-transactions-only" Bitcoin. That may happen but nobody
really knows. If it happens it may not be bad thing necessarily (ie
bitcoin microtransactions can still happen using trustless payment
channels and x is still cheaper than x% for any transacted value
higher than 100) but that's really not what we're talking about here
so it seems distraction that can only help further polirizing this
discussion.

What we're talking about here is that hitting the limit would
(hopefully) make miners start caring about fees. Enough that they stop
being irrational about free transactions. If both things happen,
non-urgent transaction fees will likely rise (as said, above zero).

You think that would be a catastrophe for adoption and I disagree.
But (as Pieter has repeatedly explained) for any size there will be
use cases that will be eventually priced out.
So when rising this consensus limit, not increasing centralization
should be the priority and the potential impact in market fees a much
more secondary concern.
Do you agree with this?

I'm sure there are many intermediate positions between "caring more
about mining centralization than market fees when deciding about a
consensus rule that limits mining centralization" and "not caring
about mining centralization at all".
I really don't want to put words in your mouth, but I honestly don't
know what your position is.
I don't really know how else can I ask the same question: you don't
care the consensus maximum blocksize rule being here at all or not
(you just said that).
Is it because you don't think it limits mining centralization or
because you don't care about limiting mining centralization with
consensus rules at all?

Unfortunately that doesn't help solve the actual issue that mining is currently consolidated within the jurisdiction of a single political body that is not exactly Bitcoin friendly. I don't know how to solve that issue aside from pointing it out and hoping miners outside of China point to different pools and build more farms in smaller countries. Venezuela for example has cheap electricity and could be a good place to mine. Iceland too.

It's interesting how realizing that the blocksize consensus limit does
the opposite of what you initially thought when starting the thread
didn't changed your conclusion from

"If you're truly worried about larger blocks causing centralization,
think about how, by restricting blocksize, you're enabling the
Communist Chinese government to maintain centralized control over 57%
of the Bitcoin hashing power."

to

"If you're truly worried about larger blocks causing centralization,
think about how, by INCREASING blocksize, you're enabling the
Communist Chinese government to POTENTIALLY INCREASE ITS centralized
control over 57% of the Bitcoin hashing power."

The new conclusion is just "somebody should mine from Venezuela and
Iceland" instead.

If you were so concerned about mining centralization, now that you
understand how the blocksize maximum influences it (by being the only
consensus rule that limits it) and if you were consequent, now you
would warn about the dangers of increasing the blocksize consensus
limit in this particular moment in time when mining centralization
looks already really bad (ie 57% hashrate in the same jurisdiction).
Another possibility is that you don't really care about mining
centralization and you were only looking for an argument in favor of
increasing the blocksize, which for some other reason you have already
concluded that must be done as soon as possible.

Mike's position is that he wants the block size limit
to eventually be removed. That is of course an extreme view. Meanwhile,
your view that the block size should be artificially constrained below the
organic growth curve (in a way that will penalize a majority of existing
and future users) lies at the other extreme. The majority position lies
somewhere in between (i.e. a one-time increase to 8MB). This is the
position that ultimately matters.

If the block size is increased to 8MB and things get demonstrably a whole
lot worse, then you will have a solid leg to stand on. In that case we can
always do another hard fork later to reduce the block size back to
something smaller, and henceforth the block size will never be touched
again.

I would say that things already demonstrately got terrible. The mining
landscape is very centralized, with apparently a majority depending on
agreements to trust each other's announced blocks without validation. Full
node count is at its historically lowest value in years, and outsourcing of
full validation keeps growing.

I believe that if the above would have happened overnight, people would
have cried wolf. But somehow it happened slow enough, and "things kept
working".

I don't think that this is a good criterion. Bitcoin can "work" with
gigabyte blocks today, if everyone uses the same few blockchain validation
services, the same few online wallets, and mining is done by a cartel that
only allows joining after signing a contract so they can sue you if you
create an invalid block. Do you think people will then agree that "things
got demonstratebly worse"?

Don't turn Bitcoin into something uninteresting, please.

Things apparently aren't bad enough to prevent the majority from clamoring
for larger blocks.

If the majority agreed that things had got worse till this point, and that
this was to be blamed on the block size, they would be campaigning for the
other direction. Even yourselves aren't asking for a reduction in the block
size, as you know full well that you would be laughed out.

I prefer to wait and let him talk by himself.

That is not my position. Again, I don't know what the right blocksize
for the short term is (I don't think anybody does).
But I know that the maximum block size limit consensus rule (no more
artificial than any other consensus rule, like, say, the one that
prohibits double-spends) serves to limit mining centralization.
Therefore how the change can affect mining centralization must be the
main concern, instead of (also artificial) projections about usage
growth (no matter how organic their curves look).
Also I don't think "hitting the limit" must be necessarily harmful and
if it is, I don't understand why hitting it at 1MB will be more
harmful than hitting it at 2MB, 8MB or 8GB.

> The majority position lies somewhere in between (i.e.

I don't know where you get your "majority" from or what it even means
(majority of users, majority of the coins, of miners?)
But there's something I'm missing something there...why my position
doesn't matter if it's not a majority?
How is what the the majority has been told it's best an objective argument?

Yes.
And if we can "break things" in simulations first before we "break
things" in production, maybe we don't need the later hardfork to "fix
things" (if it's still possible to fix them without completely
restarting the ASIC market).
The fact is that we don't have a single simulation that can tell you
"too centralized/shouldn't affect mining centralization much" for a
given block size.
So if you say 8, I must ask, why not 9?
Why 9 MB is not safe for mining centralization but 8 MB is?

There is NO criterion based on mining centralization to decide between
2 sizes in favor of the small one.
It seems like the rationale it's always "the bigger the better" and
the only limitation is what a few people concerned with mining
centralization (while they still have time to discuss this) are
willing to accept. If that's the case, then there won't be effectively
any limit in the long term and Bitcoin will probably fail in its
decentralization goals.
I think its the proponents of a blocksize change who should propose
such a criterion and now they have the tools to simulate different
block sizes.

I want us to simulate many blocksizes before rushing into a decision
(specially because I disagree that taking a decision there is urgent
in the first place).

Hector, if you could provide data that convinces why 8MB is better
than 6.18MB or 1MB then we'd get out of the realm of opinion and
pointless rhetoric that threatens to keep this debate in a quagmire.
We'd have actual figures to work with and projections to go by.

But fetching "majority" agreement (where from?) does not cut it for
setting Bitcoin on a future path. If we go by that then we'd soon be
giving coinbase rewards to users for being "loyal supporters" because,
as a majority, they think that's what they'd like to see.

If a proposal is demonstrably, and provably, a good idea - and a
developer consensus agrees - then it should go to testing, and
eventually, code. Other than that it's just conjecture and words
without a research paper and data.

In the final analysis, do we want Bitcoin to be steered by an
uninformed and fickle majority, or do we want to use this list as a
forum to present research proposals containing repeatable, verifiable
facts? A progressive process of convincing those most familiar with
Bitcoin's code and operation so they may implement Good Ideas during
the next century and after is surely preferable to Vote-my-code-Coin. :)

The degree of mining decentralization is only one of many concerns. Users'
main concern is timely confirmation of low-fee transactions. Miners'
concern is the amount of profit they make.

The limit won't even get to be hit, because all the users that get thrown
out of Bitcoin will have moved over to a system supporting a larger block
size.

The majority which the miners are beholden to is the economic majority.

Your position is only one of many and it does not carry excess weight to
the others. Individually it won't matter, because you can't control the
implementation that other people run.

Don't fight the market. The way the system is designed, the miners will
follow along with what the economic majority have decided.

So if you say 8, I must ask, why not 9?

8MB has simply been the focal point for this debate. 9MB is also safe if
8MB is, but I suppose the opponents will be even less happy with 9 than
with 8, and we don't want to unnecessarily increase the conflict.

It seems like the rationale it's always "the bigger the better" and

A one-time increase to 8MB is safer than a dynamically growing limit over
time for exactly this reason. Admittedly whenever the next debate to
increase the block size over 8MB happens it will be even more painful and
non-obvious, but that is the safety check to prevent unbounded block size
increase.

And that is a problem... why?

As far as I can tell, nobody besides miners running old and/or buggy
software lost money due to outsourced mining validation (please correct me
if I'm wrong-- I'm looking forward to Greg's post-mortem). The operators of
bitcoin.org seem to have freaked out and pushed the panic button (with dire
warnings of not trusting transactions until 20 confirmations), but theymos
was well known for using an old, patched version of Core for
blockexplorer.com so maybe that's not surprising.

As Bitcoin grows, pieces of the ecosystem will specialize. Satoshi's
original code did everything: hashing, block assembly, wallet, consensus,
network. That is changing, and that is OK.

I understand there are parts of the ecosystem you'd rather not see
specialized, like transaction selection / block assembly or validation. I
see it as a natural maturation. The only danger I see is if some unnatural
barriers to competition spring up.

> Full node count is at its historically lowest value in years, and
outsourcing of full validation keeps growing.

Both side effects of increasing specialization, in my opinion. Many
companies quite reasonably would rather hire somebody who specializes in
running nodes, keeping keys secure, etc rather than develop that expertise
themselves.

Again, not a problem UNLESS some unnatural barriers to competition spring
up.

I understand you want to build an extremely decentralized system, where
everybody participating trusts nothing except the genesis block hash.

I think it is more interesting to build a system that works for hundreds of
millions of people, with no central point of control and the opportunity
for ANYBODY to participate at any level. Permission-less innovation is what
I find interesting.

And I think the current "demonstrably terrible" Bitcoin system is still
INCREDIBLY interesting.

Nobody is preventing anyone from claiming anything. Some developers
are encouraging users to ask for bigger blocks.
Others don't want to impose consensus rule changes against the will of
the users (even if they're 10% of the users).
Still, "Things apparently aren't bad enough" is just your opinion.

1) I don't care what the so-called "majority" thinks: I don't want to
impose consensus rule changes against the will of a reasonable
minority.
2) It doesn't matter who is to blame about the current centralization:
the fact remains that the blocksize maximum is the only** consensus
rule to limit mining centralization.
3) In fact I think Luke Dashjr proposed to reduced it to 400 KB, but I
would ask the same thing: please create a simulation in which the
change is better (or at least no much worse) than the current rules by
ANY metric.

Please read the point 2 with special attention because it's not the
first time I say this in this thread.

** There's also the maximum block sigops consensus rule to limit
mining centralization.

Repeating a claim ad-nauseum doesn't make it necessarily true. A block size
limit won't prevent miners in the future from buying each other out.

Jorge will answer for himself, but you know that saying "9MB is also
safe if 8MB is" blows your position.

Do you, or me, or XT know that 8MB is "safe"? You say 9MB must then
also be "safe" - there has been no fact for me to grasp and from which
to tell a Bitcoin trading whale group: "here's the bottom line: this
is what it means and these are the implications." They hold
significant amounts of bitcoin and want to see a plan, and a strategy
based on facts. I can assure you, they're not going to XT, it lacks
both a strategy and the seasoned developers present here.

You're articulate and you raise valid issues, but your judgment of
"safer" is not based on anything you or this list can refer to as a
comparator.

It seems you want 8MB for some ideological reason but if you examine
your motive and compare it to the facts, you'll find that many people
in this list are ultimately correct in saying that:

Whatever blocksize is set to, demand will soon fill it.

This is the nature of resource supply inflation - some business plan
will spot the opportunity and exploit it, colonize it and then we deal
with that, with some big-girls'-blouses exclaiming: "if we don't give
them what they want they're all going to leave to XT or ZT!"

Even though XT and ZT perfectly fulfill the needs of certain ambitious
businesses, the creators would rather see it happen on Core's
blockchain. Else why do they still come posit arguments here?

Fortunately, unlike the principle that applies in finance capital,
Bitcoin capacity supply doesn't have be increased on demand (not
without rigorous testing and evaluation) plus there is no maxim here
that "the customer is always right". The maxim is "be your own bank" -
during some periods it might be a slow bank but it _will_ remain
decentralized and it _will_ remain your own - not compromised to some
big business or mining cartel.

We want to compromise to science and reason, not profit motive or
democratic lobbying, right?

No, I think 1 MB is just as arbitrary as any other size proposed.

No, if the changed rule only serves to limit centralization, then how
that limitation to centralization is affected should be the first
thing to consider.
If miners' concern was only the amount of profit they make they
wouldn't mine free transactions already.
You cannot possibly know what all users' are concern about, so I will
just ignore any further claim in that direction.
Talk for yourself: your arguments won't be more reasonable just
because you claim that all users think like you do.

I disagree with this wild prediction as well.

Nobody can't control the implementation that I (or other people
concerned with centralization) run either.

How is allowing fees from rising above zero "fighting the market"?
The system is currently designed with a 1 MB limit. I don't think
that's sacred or anything, but I really don't feel like I'm fighting
"the market" or "the way the system is designed".
In any case, what do "the market" and "the way the system is designed"
have to do with what the majority have been told it's best (which you
seem to think should be a source of truth for some reason I'm still
missing)?

Why 9 MB is safe but 10 MB isn't?
The "conflict" won't be resolved by evading hard questions...

Will there ever be a debate that results in "further blocksize
increases at this point are very risky for mining centralization"?
How will we tell then? Can't we use the same criteria now?

It plays both ways, the technical list requires a proof of concept and
simulation upon which to base judgment going forward, else we'll just
be talking out our backsides (like certain people) without making any
progress.

The tools for simulation exist: Jorge Timon created a variable
blocksize regtest PR here:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6382

No-one needs to postulate what different blocksizes imply  - anyone
can run a simulation and demonstrate what they're talking about.

If miners need to form alliances of trusting each other's blocks without
validation to overcome the inefficiencies of slow block propagation, I
think we have a system that is in direct conflict with the word
"permissionless" that you use later.

That is not true, I'm sorry if that is the impression I gave.

I see centralization and scalability as a trade-off, and for better or for
worse, the block chain only offers one trade-off. I want to see technology
built on top that introduces lower levels of trust than typical fully
centralized systems, while offering increased convenience, speed,
reliability, and scale. I just don't think that all of that can happen on
the lowest layer without hurting everything built on top. We need different
trade-offs, and the blockchain is just one, but a very fundamental one.

That sounds amazing, but do you think that Bitcoin, as it exists today, can
scale to hundreds of millions of users, while retaining any glimpse of
permission-lessness and decentralization? I think we need low-trust
off-chain systems and other innovations to make that happen.

I'm happy for you, then.

?The scicast prediction market is shutdown atm (since early July?) so those
numbers aren't live. But...

Network hash rate
3,255.17 PH/s  (same block size)
5,032.64 PH/s  (block size increase)

4,969.68 PH/s  (no replace-by-fee)
3,132.09 PH/s  (replace-by-fee)

Those numbers seem completely implausible: that's ~2.9-3.6 doublings of the
current hashrate (< 400PH/s) in 17 months, when it's taken 12 months for
the last doubling, and there's a block reward reduction due in that period
too. (That might've been a reasonable prediction sometime in the past year,
when doublings were slowing from once every ~45 days to once a year; it
just doesn't seem a supportable prediction now)

That the PH/s rate is higher with bigger blocks is surprising, but given
that site also predicts USD/BTC will be $280 with no change but $555 with
bigger blocks, so I assume that difference is mostly due to price. Also,
12.5btc at $555 each is about 23 btc at $300 each, so if that price
increase is realistic, it would compensate for almost all of the block
reward reduction.

Daily transaction volume
168,438.22 tx/day  (same block size)
193,773.08 tx/day  (block size increase)

192,603.80 tx/day  (no replace-by-fee)
168,406.73 tx/day  (replace-by-fee)

That's only a 15% increase in transaction volume due to the block size
increase; I would have expected more? 168k-194k tx/day is also only a
30%-50% increase in transaction volume from 130k tx/day currently. If
that's really the case, then a 1.5MB-2MB max block size would probably be
enough for the next two years...

(Predicting that the node count will drop from ~5000 to ~1200 due to
increasing block sizes seems quite an indictment as far as centralisation
risks go; but given I'm not that convinced by the other predictions, I'm
not sure I want to give that much weight to that one either)

Cheers,
aj

It's a big problem. What are you dismissing it for?

With Bitcoin in fledgling 0.x version state this is neither desirable
nor encouraging.

Development did not freeze at some time in the past and now we see how
the userbase reacts. Miners, btw, are arguibly still a class of user
as long as they are guaranteed coinbase.

When they start making and proving themselves useful in a free
floating fee market absent coinbase subsidy, we can revisit this
topic, with the benefit of hindsight.

Pieter never said it wasn't interesting, so this emphatic statement is
strange - like someone is trying to convince an audience - but
anyway... as you, a veritable spring-chicken by your actions and
words, said the other day: having graduated in '88 you're "old" and
speak from experience. Don't come with that jive, bossy man - bring
facts and testing to the technical list.

My finance readers, in one camp, and Bitcoin investors, in the other,
want to see the XT 8MB hard-fork testing data that you mentioned for
BIP100.

It's a big problem. What are you dismissing it for?

With Bitcoin in fledgling 0.x version state this is neither desirable
nor encouraging.

Development did not freeze at some time in the past and now we see how
the userbase reacts. Miners, btw, are arguibly still a class of user
as long as they are guaranteed coinbase.

When they start making and proving themselves useful in a free
floating fee market absent coinbase subsidy, we can revisit this
topic, with the benefit of hindsight.

Pieter never said it wasn't interesting, so this emphatic statement is
strange - like someone is trying to convince an audience - but
anyway... as you, a veritable spring-chicken by your actions and
words, said the other day: having graduated in '88 you're "old" and
speak from experience. Don't come with that jive, bossy man - bring
facts and testing to the technical list.

My finance readers, in one camp, and Bitcoin investors, in the other,
want to see the XT 8MB hard-fork testing data that you mentioned for
BIP100.

I'm also looking forward to Greg's post-mortem, because I had a completely
different takeaway from the BIP66 mini-forks.  My view is that despite the
extremely cautious and conservative planning for the completely
uncontentious fork, the damage could and would have been very significant
if it had not been for several core devs manually monitoring, intervening
and problem solving for other network participants.  I don't believe thats
the way the system should work.  Participants in the Bitcoin community have
come to rely on the devs for just making sure everything works for them.
That's not sustainable.  The system needs to be made fundamentally more
secure if its going to succeed, not depend on the good will of any
particular parties, otherwise it certainly will no longer be permissionless.

The BIP66 fork was urgently required to fix an undisclosed consensus bug,
unanimously agreed on and without technical objection, and it was still
fraught with problems.  That's the most clear cut example of when we should
have a fork.  A change to a consensus limit that a significant proportion
of the community disagrees with for economic or technical reasons or both
should be raising a sea of red flags.

But reading it 10 times may help you understand the claim, you will
never find out until you try.
"Miners buying each other out" is not the only way in which mining
centralization can get even worse.
A Blocksize limit may not be able to prevent such a scenario, but it's
still the only consensus tool to limit mining centralization.
If you want to prove that claim wrong you need to find a
counter-example of another consensus rule that somehow limits mining
centralization.
You could also prove that this rule doesn't help with mining
centralization at all. But that's much more difficult and if you just
claim it (and consequently advocate for the complete removal of the
consensus rule) we will have already advanced a lot.
But you denying that the limits serves limiting mining centralization
and at the same time advocating for keeping a limit at all doesn't
seem very consistent.
If you don't want that rule to limit mining centralization pressures,
what do you want it for?

Given there is no money at stake in these prediction games, it is no surprise that the results are implausible.

The paper is nicely done, but I'm concerned that there's a real problem with equation 4. The orphan rate is not just a function of time; it's also a function of the block maker's proportion of the network hash rate. Fundamentally a block maker (pool or aggregation of pools) does not orphan its own blocks. In a degenerate case a 100% pool has no orphaned blocks. Consider that a 1% miner must assume a greater risk from orphaning than, say, a pool with 25%, or worse 40% of the hash rate.

I suspect this may well change some of the conclusions as larger block makers will definitely be able to create larger blocks than their smaller counterparts.


Cheers,
Dave

> Abstract.  This paper shows how a rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node?s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit. To show this, the paper introduces the block space supply curve and the mempool demand curve.  The former describes the cost for a miner to supply block space by accounting for orphaning risk.  The latter represents the fees offered by the transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim a given portion of the fees.  The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the miner?s profit.  The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market?where miners are incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks?cannot exist since it requires communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate.  The paper concludes by considering the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and by estimating the cost of a spam attack.

I'm talking about the non-reorg case. Without reorg, you know what the
next height or current median time is, but you don't know what the
next block time is.

How does bitcoin-tx know about the next block time?
It doesn't. You would need to use the current time as a proxy for the
median time or the block.nTime which you don't know either.
Or just keep the sanity check as it is. Note that this case is
blocksize-specific: other hardforks (like my previous example, or the
code proposal in BIP99) don't share that concern.

One thing I've noticed there seems to be disagreement on is whether
miners' upgrade confirmation (aka voting) is necessary for
uncontroversial hardforks or not.
In BIP99 the advice for uncontroversial hardforks is setting a
threshold (based on height, but we can change it) and then wait for
95% of the hashrate to upgrade to enforce the chain.
But maybe the "voting" can happen first and then the threshold is
added to the "miners' confirmation height/time".
I think that may influence which of the three discussed options
(height, block time and median time) is better, so maybe we should
discuss that first.

Quite correct; this paper is fatally flawed and at best rehashes what we already know happens in the "spherical cow" case, without making it clear that it refers to a completely unrealistic setup. It'd be interested to know who actually wrote it - "Peter R" is obviously a pseudonym and the paper goes into sufficient detail that it makes you wonder why the author didn't see the flaws in it.

For those wishing to do actual research, esp. people such as profs mentoring students, keep in mind that in Bitcoin situations where large miners have an advantage over small miners are security exploits, with severity proportional to the difference in profitability. A good example of the type of analysis required is the well known selfish mining paper, which shows how a miner adopting a "selfish" strategy has an advantage - more profit per unit hashing power - than miners who do not adopt that strategy, and additionally, that excess profits scales with increasing hashing power.

As for the OP, if this wasn't an attempt at misinformation, my apologies. But keep in mind that you're wading into a highly politically charged research field with billions hanging on the blocksize limit; understand that people aren't happy when flawed papers end up on reddit being used to promote bad ideas. You'd be wise to run future work past experts in the field prior to publishing widely if you dislike heated controversy.

Unless the block maker has an infinitely fast connection to it's hashpower
OR it's hashpower is not parallelized at all, that's not strictly true --
it WILL orphan its own blocks because two hashing units will find solutions
in the time it takes to communicate that solution to the block maker and to
the rest of the hashing units.

That's getting into "how many miners can dance on the head of a pin"
territory, though. I don't think we know whether the communication
advantages of putting lots of hashing power physically close together will
outweigh the extra cooling costs of doing that (or maybe some other
tradeoff I haven't thought of). That would be a fine topic for another
paper....

I'd suggest you do more research into how Bitcoin and mining works as the above has a number of serious misunderstandings.

Or, I could just point out the obvious rather than try to be polite: you know exactly why the above makes no sense as a reply to this thread and are deliberately lying.

If the situation is the latter, your conduct is toxic to the development mailing list discussion, not to mention a waste of all our time, and you should leave.

To be clear, without a strong supermajority of miner support the fork risks attack. Requiring 95% approval - which is actually just a 50% majority vote as the majority can squelch the minority - is an obvious minimum safety requirement.

Another option is Hearn's proposal of using centralised checkpoints to override PoW consensus; obviously that raises serious questions, including legal issues.

For forks without miner approval miners have a number of options to defeat them. For instance, they can make their own fork with a new consensus algorithm that requires miners to prove they're attacking the unwanted chain - Garzik's recent 2MB blocks proposal is a hilarious, and probably accidental, example of such a design, with the original Bitcoin protocol rules having the effect of attacking the Garzik 2MB chain.

Yes, but the block maker won't publish the second block it finds for the same set of transactions. It won't orphan its own block. In fact even if it does it still doesn't matter because the block maker still gets the block reward irrespective of which of the two solutions are published.

It's not about which hash wins, the issue is who gets paid as a result.

Researchers should also keep in mind that some of developers are 
immature and have limited knowledge or experience beyond their Bitcoin 
expertise ("Idiot-savants").  Others want to be in "charge" of 
drama-laced posts on reddit and they get upset if others do the same 
things.

In any case these rants and attacks by Todd and Garzik should be posted 
on their personal blogs or reddit instead of this list.

I very rarely comment on list politics but isn't this the kettle calling
the pot black?

Back to my hole now I promise.

That the PH/s rate is higher with bigger blocks is surprising, but given that site also predicts USD/BTC will be $280 with no change but $555 with bigger blocks, so I assume that difference is mostly due to price. Also, 12.5btc at $555 each is about 23 btc at $300 each, so if that price increase is realistic, it would compensate for almost all of the block reward reduction.

I don't think merely hitting the limit is bad. The level of tx fees in
equilibrium give some clue as to the level of harm being done. If fees are
at $5/tx at 1MB, it's about as bad as if fees are at $5/tx at 4MB.

In the absence of harder data, it might be interesting to use these
simulations to graph centralization pressure as a function of bandwidth
cost over time (or other historical variables that affect centralization).
For instance, look at how high centralization pressure was in 2009
according to the simulations, given how cheap/available bandwidth was then,
compared to 2010, 2011, etc. Then we could figure out: given today's
bandwidth situation, what size blocks right now would give us the same
centralization pressure that we had in 2011, 2012, 2013, etc?

Of course this doesn't mean we should blindly assume that the level of
centralization pressure in 2012 was acceptable, and therefore any block
size increase that results in the same amount of pressure now should be
acceptable. But it might lead to a more productive discussion.

IMO it is not urgent if the core devs are committed to reacting to a huge
spike in tx fees with a modest block size increase in a relatively short
time frame, if they judge the centralization risks of that increase to be
small. Greg Maxwell posted on reddit a while back something to the effect
of "the big block advocates are overstating the urgency of the block size
increase, because if there was actually a situation that required us to
increase block size, we could make the increase when it was actually
needed." I found that somewhat persuasive, but I am concerned that I
haven't seen any discussion of what the "let's wait for now" camp would
consider a valid reason to increase block size in the short term, and how
they'd make the tradeoff with tx fees or whatever else was necessitating
the increase.

Jorge, if a fee equilibrium developed at 1MB of $5/tx, and you somehow knew
with certainty that increasing to 4MB would result in a 20 cent/tx
equilibrium that would last for a year (otherwise fees would stay around $5
for that year), would you be in favor of an increase to 4MB?

For those familiar with the distinction between near/far mode thinking
popularized by Robin Hanson: focusing on concrete examples like this
encourages problem solving and consensus, and focusing on abstract
principles (like decentralization vs. usability in general) leads to people
toward using argument to signal their alliances and reduce the status of
their opponents. I think it'd be very helpful if more 1MB advocates
described what exactly would make them say "OK, in this situation a block
size increase is needed, we should do one quickly!", and also if
Gavin/Mike/Jeff described what hypothetical scenarios and/or test results
would make them want to stick with 1MB blocks for now.

With all due respect Gavin, large-block advocates appear to hold the position that:
* pushing individual economic actors away from running full nodes is a natural and unproblematic consequence of block size increase, as they're expected to rely on SPV
You now also appear to hold the position that:
* pushing miners to SPV mining is unproblematic

Have I misunderstood? Is one of these not an expected outcome of large blocks? I can understand the validity of either argument alone -- the assertion that we can trust miners to validate and just trust most-POW ourselves, /or/ the assertion that lack of miner validation is safe under certain circumstances. But together?

Who do you expect to actually validate large blocks if not miners, and what do you expect their incentive to do so to be?

Very interesting paper. When you talk about a market, what are you
referring to exactly? A market means that demand and supply are matched
continuously, and Bitcoin has no such mechanism. A lot of discussion has
been around fixing the "supply" of blocksize. A floating number would mean
that a hardcoded number or function would be replaced by a decision process
involving users (demand). I don't think a fee market exists and that demand
or supply are not easily definable. Ideally supply of transaction
capability would completely depend on demand, and a price would exist such
that demand can react to longterm or shorterm supply constraints. In such a
scenario there would be no scalability concerns, as scale would be almost
perfectly elastic.

Not all markets need to have highly liquid trading outlets in order to be
thought of as such. Inefficient markets are where there is an imperfect
matching mechanism.

Demand and supply are reflected in the market in the following two prices:
- BTC/USD
- Average transaction fee levels * Average transaction volume rate. In
other words, this is the block-by-block, remainder of the block reward
after subtracting the subsidy and priced in BTC.

Actually the first one is the only proxy reflecting the current and future
promise of Bitcoin, while the second only reflects the present. Miners
would be uniquely placed to know how best to vary the block size to
maximize their profit resulting from these two prices. The fact that they
are unable to is limiting their collective profits, reducing competition
between miners and increasing the average tx fee for users.

In that respect a dynamic block size voted on by miners periodically would
go some way to rectify this inefficiency. This needn't have to happen on
the block chain itself; we could have a continuous prediction market for
the block size, and the informed participants (miners) would stand to
profit from the uninformed from trading in such a market. How to get the
block chain to use the block size thus determined is another technical
matter.

This kind of thing has been discussed here, even recently.  It is not
without problems.

You may find the flexcap idea summarised in outline by Greg Maxwell
and Mark Friedenbach a month or so back interesting in showing that
one can achieve such effects without handing over a free vote to
miners and hence avoid many (though probably not all) of the
side-effects inherent in giving miners control.

About side-effects, I think we can make argument that there are limits
because other than in an extremis sense, miners are not necessarily in
alignment with security, nor maximising user utility and value
delivered.

For example switching cost economics are common in networks (cell
phone service pricing), maybe Bitcoin would have a really high
switching cost if miners would cartelise.

Also miners are in a complex game competing with each other, and this
degree of control risks selfish mining issues or other cartel attacks
or bandwidth/verification/latency related attacks being made worse.
eg see the recent paper by Aviv Zohar.

Generally speaking economically dependent full nodes are holding
miners honest by design.  Changing that dynamic by shifting influence
can have security and control impacting side-effects, and needs to be
thought about carefully.

About security to try to make those comparisons a bit more formal I
posted this taxonomy of types of security that proposals could be
compared against, in order of security:

1. consensus rule (your block is invalid if you attack)
2. economic incentive alignment (you tend to lose money if you attack)
3. overt (attack possible but detectable, hence probably less likely
to happen for reputation or market signal reasons even if possible
anonymously)
4. meta incentive (assume people would not attack if they have an
investment or interest in seeing Bitcoin continue to succeed)

Thank you for the feedback, Benjamin.

> When you talk about a market, what are you referring to exactly?

I define what I mean by healthy, unhealthy, and non-existent markets in Section 7, and I show a figure to illustrate the supply and demand curves in each of these three cases.  A healthy market is defined as one where a rational miner would be incentivized to produce a finite block.  An unhealthy market is one where a miner would be incentivized to produce an arbitrarily large block.  A non-existant market is one where a miner is better off publishing an empty block.  I show that so long as block space in a normal economic commodity that obeys the Law of Demand, and that the Shannon-Hartley theorem applies to the communication of the block solutions between miners, that an unhealthy market is not possible.  

>  A market means that demand and supply are matched continuously, and Bitcoin has no such mechanism.

Take a look at my definitions for the mempool demand curve (Sec 4) and the block space supply curve (Sec 5).  I show that the miner's profit is a maximum at the point where the derivatives of these two curves intersect.  I think of this as when "demand and supply are matched."

> ...I don't think a fee market exists and that demand or supply are not easily definable.

Do you not find the definitions presented in the paper for these curves useful?  The mempool demand curve represents the empirical demand measureable from a miner?s mempool, while the block space supply curve represents the additional cost to create a block of size Q by accounting for orphaning risk.  

> Ideally supply of transaction capability would completely depend on demand, and a price would exist such that demand can react to longterm or shorterm supply constraints.

Supply and demand do react.  For example, if the cost to produce block space decreases (e.g., due to improvements in network interconnectivity) then a miner will be able to profitably include a greater number of transactions in his block.  

Furthermore, not only is there a minimum fee density below which no rational miner should include any transactions as Gavin observed, but the required fee density for inclusion also naturally increases if demand for space within a block is elevated.  A rational miner will not necessarily include all fee-paying transactions, as urgent higher-paying transactions bump lower-fee transactions out, thereby bidding up the minimum fee density exponentially with demand.

> In such a scenario there would be no scalability concerns, as scale would be almost perfectly elastic.

Agreed.  

Best regards,
Peter

> Abstract.  This paper shows how a rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node?s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit. To show this, the paper introduces the block space supply curve and the mempool demand curve.  The former describes the cost for a miner to supply block space by accounting for orphaning risk.  The latter represents the fees offered by the transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim a given portion of the fees.  The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the miner?s profit.  The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market?where miners are incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks?cannot exist since it requires communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate.  The paper concludes by considering the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and by estimating the cost of a spam attack.

The market I am thinking of would be open to all, not just miners. But
miners would probably be best placed to profit from such a market, as it is
their business to know about the revenue/costs tradeoff.

If the block size was increasing at every settlement date (the dates on
which, every 3 months say, the block size would be adjusted to the level
indicated by the market) and users were getting concerned about
centralization, the natural tendency would be for:
a) The block size prediction market would tend to go back down.
b) BTC/USD would tend to go down, reducing miner profit and indicating to
them that the block size is too high.
c) Transaction rate would decrease as some users stop using Bitcoin, also
decreasing miner profit.

This prediction market in block-size seems like something extremely
complex to operate and keep secure in a decentralised fashion.  There
are several experimental projects right now trying to figure out how
to do this securely, using blockchain ideas, but it is early days for
those projects.

We also have no particular reason to suppose other than
meta-incentive, that it should result in a secure parameter set.

I suspect that, while it is interesting in the abstract, it risks
converting a complex security problem into an even more complex one,
rather than constituting an incremental security improvement which is
more the context of day to day discussions here.

Why would it need to be decentralised? Bitcoin.org could run the exchange,
and the profits from the exchange could be used to fund Core development.

Security is a continuous variable, trading off against others. If security
gradually begins to be threatened as a result of block size gradually
increasing, the concerns of users will be enough that the bears will gain
control over the bulls on the block size market.

I suspect that, while it is interesting in the abstract, it risks

Those numbers seem completely implausible: that's ~2.9-3.6 doublings of the current hashrate (< 400PH/s) in 17 months, when it's taken 12 months for the last doubling, and there's a block reward reduction due in that period too. (That might've been a reasonable prediction sometime in the past year, when doublings were slowing from once every ~45 days to once a year; it just doesn't seem a supportable prediction now)
That the PH/s rate is higher with bigger blocks is surprising, but given that site also predicts USD/BTC will be $280 with no change but $555 with bigger blocks, so I assume that difference is mostly due to price. Also, 12.5btc at $555 each is about 23 btc at $300 each, so if that price increase is realistic, it would compensate for almost all of the block reward reduction.

That's only a 15% increase in transaction volume due to the block size increase; I would have expected more? 168k-194k tx/day is also only a 30%-50% increase in transaction volume from 130k tx/day currently. If that's really the case, then a 1.5MB-2MB max block size would probably be enough for the next two years...
(Predicting that the node count will drop from ~5000 to ~1200 due to increasing block sizes seems quite an indictment as far as centralisation risks go; but given I'm not that convinced by the other predictions, I'm not sure I want to give that much weight to that one either)

To put some flesh on the bones of this idea, imagine a hypothetical
security named BLK. Demand for bigger blocks should buy up BLK and demand
for smaller blocks should short BLK. The price of BLK in BTC is the ideal
block size.
Now imagine that there are futures contracts for the security BLK. On the
settlement date of those futures the current BLK/BTC price of those futures
is taken to be the new Bitcoin block size for the next 3 months.
For instance, if I predict or want the block size to be higher on September
than it currently is, I would buy up September BLK futures. My actions
would nudge the price up, and if come September I am right I get what I
want and have a floating profit on the futures market.
The nice thing about a futures market is that it allows capacity planning
for the months ahead. Also there is no need for an underlying BLK security
for a futures market in BLKs to exist.
If the market is efficient and correctly sets the block size, BTC/USD will
rise and the BTC profits of the market participants will go up in USD terms
as a result.

Message-ID: <CALwsPgnnkbfUBhL=Qyspz13pnZ-6RHdaZOGvfLG34JjJRgt2Dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all.

We?d like to share an idea we have to dramatically increase the bitcoin
block propagation speed after a new block has been mined for the first time.

Efficient bitcoin block propagation
A proposed solution to provide near-instantaneous block propagation on the
bitcoin network, even with slow network connections or large block sizes.
Increasing mining efficiency for everyone while decreasing transaction
confirmation times and strengthening the distributed nature of bitcoin.

Short summary: we propose to introduce bitcoin-backed guarantees
(?Guarantee Messages?) between miners. This would allow miners to mine on
blocks that are not yet fully transmitted. This reduces the effect of slow
internet connections, leveling the playing field between the 1st world
fiberoptic datacenter miners and the rest of the world. We also believe it
strengthens the bitcoin network by using existing processing power that is
currently wasted into further securing the blockchain, and it reduces the
likelihood of transactions becoming confirmed, then unconfirmed and then
-hopefully- confirmed again (due to different miners finding competing
blocks with different transactions at approx the same time).

It is possible to implement our idea as a fork of bitcoind, or as layer
between the standard bitcoind and the mining equipment. In the future it
could be incorporated in the bitcoin core if and when that becomes a
priority, but that step would not make sense until it becomes a priority.

There are a lot of nuances in this idea, and the first reaction is quite
probably that this is a crazy idea. We have attempted to address the most
important nuances in our proposal, which is currently at v.0.2.

We cannot guarantee that there are no ?hidden devils in the details? and we
invite you to be critical in a friendly and constructive manner. We will do
our best to answer all questions that arise.

The ?official? proposal is at:

I'm not sure how bip102 is less secure than other blocksize proposal
but please let's keep defects specific to each proposal in their own
threads.
In any case, I understand that you agree that 95% confirmation is a
good idea for uncontroversial hardforks (like in uncontroversial
softforks).
I'm not sure if you prefer that to happen before or after the time
threshold, but I guess you're fine with doing it after the threshold
since you didn't complained about that specifically (you can always
clarify your preferences of course).

Thanks for the reply. My understanding is that the bitcoin relay network is
a backbone of connected high speed servers to increase the rate at which
transactions and new blocks propagate - and remove a number of delays in
processing. But it would still require the miners to download the entire
block before building on top of it with any degree of confidence. With a
tweak to only send the required information for other miners to build on
top of that block, this is a step towards what we propose, yet would
require trust that the header information sent is accurate. The bitcoin
relay network website states that blocks are not fully verified and should
be checked by the miners before building on top of them.

What we propose is more complex (granted!), yet that complexity serves a
purpose. We reduce (and hopefully eliminate) the adverse incentive to
entice miners to build on inaccurate data. This is achieved by making the
financial losses of fake messages outweigh the financial gains of such
attack vectors. It could also help in the block size debate if this
proposed solution would eliminate the disadvantages of large blocks.

Your understanding is outdated.

The relay network includes an optimized transmission protocol which
enables sending the "entire" block typically in just a smal number of
bytes (much smaller than the summaries you suggest, which still leave
the participants needing to send the block).

E.g. block 000ce90846 was 999950 bytes and the relay network protocol
sent it using at most 4906 bytes.

No trust is required in this scheme because the entire block is
communicated using only a couple packets.

The current scheme is highly simplified and its efficiency could be
increased greatly with small improvements, or if miners created blocks
in an aware manner.... but with a maximum size blocks turning into 5kb
with the current setup, there hardly appears to be a reason to do so
right now.

Ultimately there is no need for information communicated with a block
at discovery time proportional to the size of the block; with the
right affordances it can be accomplished with a small constant amount
of data.

If not for this already being deployed I personally believe the
network would have already fallen into complete centeralization as a
response to larger blocks: this was constructed and deployed in order
to pull the network back from having a single pool with more than half
the hashrate.

Thanks for this (direct) feedback. It would make sense that if blocks can
be submitted using ~5kb packets, that no further optimizations would be
needed at this point. I will look into the relay network transmission
protocol to understand how it works!

I hear that you are saying that this network solves speed of transmission
and thereby (technical) block size issues. Presumably it would solve speed
of block validation too by prevalidating transactions. Assuming this is all
true, and I have no reason to doubt that at this point, I do not understand
why there is any discussion at all about the (technical) impact of large
blocks, or why there are large numbers of miners building on invalid blocks
(SPV mining, https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining), or why
there is any discussion about the speed of block validation (cpu processing
time to verify blocks and transactions in blocks being a limitation).

Our proposal aims at solving all three issues.

Now I would be glad if the suggestions we made are already implemented,
especially if that is in a more elegant approach. Great! Yet we still see
all three discussions, which is a surprise if they have been solved.

Correct. Bitcoin Core has cached validation for many years now... if
not for that and other optimizations, things would be really broken
right now. :)

I'm also mystified by a lot of the large block discussion, much of it
is completely divorced from the technology as deployed; much less what
we-- in industry-- know to be possible. I don't blame you or anyone in
particular on this; it's a new area and we don't yet know what we need
to know to know what we need to know; or to the extent that we do it
hasn't had time to get effectively communicated.

The technical/security implications of larger blocks are related to
other things than propagation time, if you assume people are using the
available efficient relay protocol (or better).

SPV mining is a bit of a misnomer (If I coined the term, I'm sorry).
What these parties are actually doing is blinding mining on top of
other pools' stratum work. You can think of it as sub-pooling with
hopping onto whatever pool has the highest block (I'll call it VFSSP
in this post-- validation free stratum subpooling).  It's very easy to
implement, and there are other considerations.

It was initially deployed at a time when a single pool in Europe has
amassed more than half of the hashrate. This pool had propagation
problems and a very high orphan rate, it may have (perhaps
unintentionally) been performing a selfish mining attack; mining off
their stratum work was an easy fix which massively cut down the orphan
rates for anyone who did it.  This was before the relay network
protocol existed (the fact that all the hashpower was consolidating on
a single pool was a major motivation for creating it).

VFSSP also cuts through a number of practical issues miners have had:
Miners that run their own bitcoin nodes in far away colocation
(>100ms) due to local bandwidth or connectivity issues (censored
internet); relay network hubs not being anywhere near by due to
strange internet routing (e.g. japan to china going via the US for ...
reasons...); the CreateNewBlock() function being very slow and
unoptimized, etc.   There are many other things like this-- and VFSSP
avoids them causing delays even when you don't understand them or know
about them. So even when they're easily fixed the VFSSP is a more
general workaround.

Mining operations are also usually operated in a largely fire and
forget manner. There is a long history in (esp pooled) mining where
someone sets up an operation and then hardly maintains it after the
fact... so some of the use of VFSSP appears to just be inertia-- we
have better solutions now, but they they work to deploy and changing
things involves risk (which is heightened by a lack of good
monitoring-- participants learn they are too latent by observing
orphaned blocks at a cost of 25 BTC each).

One of the frustrating things about incentives in this space is that
bad outcomes are possible even when they're not necessary. E.g. if a
miner can lower their orphan rate by deploying a new protocol (or
simply fixing some faulty hardware in their infrastructure, like
Bitcoin nodes running on cheap VPSes with remote storage)  OR they can
lower their orphan rate by pointing their hashpower at a free
centeralized pool, they're likely to do the latter because it takes
less effort.

Hi Dave,

Thank you for the feedback regarding my paper.  

> The paper is nicely done, but I'm concerned that there's a real problem with equation 4. The orphan rate is not just a function of time; it's also a function of the block maker's proportion of the network hash rate. Fundamentally a block maker (pool or aggregation of pools) does not orphan its own blocks.

With the benefit of hindsight, I think the paper would be stronger if it also analyzed how the model changes (or doesn't) if we assume zero propagation impedance for intra-miner communication, as you suggested (the "you don't orphan your own blocks" idea).  Note that the paper did briefly discuss miner-dependent propagation times in the second paragraph of page 9 and in note 13.  

> In a degenerate case a 100% pool has no orphaned blocks.

Agreed.  In this case there's no information to communicate (since the miner has no peers) and so the Shannon-Hartley limit doesn't apply.  My model makes no attempt to explain this case.  

> Consider that a 1% miner must assume a greater risk from orphaning than, say, a pool with 25%, or worse 40% of the hash rate.

I'd like to explore this in more detail.  Although a miner may not orphan his own block, by building on his own block he may now orphan two blocks in a row.  At some point, his solution or solutions must be communicated to his peers.  And if there's information about the transactions in his blocks to communicate, I think there's a cost associated with that.  It's an interesting problem and I'd like to continue working on it.  

> I suspect this may well change some of the conclusions as larger block makers will definitely be able to create larger blocks than their smaller counterparts.

It will be interesting to see.  I suspect that the main result that "a healthy fee market exists" will still hold (assuming of course that a single miner with >50% of the hash power isn't acting maliciously).  Whether miners with larger value of h/H have a profit advantage, I'm not sure (but that was outside the scope of the paper anyways).

>> Abstract.  This paper shows how a rational Bitcoin miner should select transactions from his node?s mempool, when creating a new block, in order to maximize his profit in the absence of a block size limit. To show this, the paper introduces the block space supply curve and the mempool demand curve.  The former describes the cost for a miner to supply block space by accounting for orphaning risk.  The latter represents the fees offered by the transactions in mempool, and is expressed versus the minimum block size required to claim a given portion of the fees.  The paper explains how the supply and demand curves from classical economics are related to the derivatives of these two curves, and proves that producing the quantity of block space indicated by their intersection point maximizes the miner?s profit.  The paper then shows that an unhealthy fee market?where miners are incentivized to produce arbitrarily large blocks?cannot exist since it requires communicating information at an arbitrarily fast rate.  The paper concludes by considering the conditions under which a rational miner would produce big, small or empty blocks, and by estimating the cost of a spam attack.

I think this would be really interesting. It's an area that seems to be lacking research.

While I've not had time to model it I did have a quick discussion with the author of the Organ-of-Corti blog a few months ago and he seemed to think that the Poisson process model isn't quite accurate here. Intuitively this makes sense as until a block has fully propagated we're only seeing some fraction of the actual hashing network operating on the same problem, so we actually see slightly fewer very quick blocks than we might expect.

I do suspect that if we were to model this more accurately we might be able to infer the "typical" propagation characteristics by measuring the deviation from the expected distribution.

I really look forward to seeing the revised version. Seeing the differences will also help assess how much impact there is from simplified models.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Superluminal communication and the consensus block
	size limit
Message-ID: <CABm2gDoF41_1g25F-+ujohGTTFPAZJCX+Xg1QPvt=jYijvb32g@mail.gmail.com>

There is a common meme that block propagation times is the only metric
that matters when it comes to value the block size maximum consensus
rule's usefulness in limiting mining centralization.
Here is an extremely optimist thought experiment for those who think
that is the case:

Imagine that superluminal communication has somehow been invented and
validity of mined blocks can be checked in constant time thanks to
some sort of snarks magic. This doesn't mean that block propagation is
O(1) with respect to time because each node needs to repeat that cheap
validation before relaying the block.
Still, this is the best situation we can imagine with respect to block
propagation, right?
No, wait, due to some technical or economical miracle this
superluminal communication is free for everyone:
better-than-physically-possible (our understanding of physics changes
with time as well, right?) communication and infinite bandwidth for
everyone.

At this point, does the consensus block size maximum still help
limiting mining centralization or we can just remove it entirely?
The answer is yes, it can help limit mining centralization.

Let's imagine that these amazing advancements have happened in less
than 22 years and we only had 6 more subsidy halvings, that's only 7
halvings in total, so the subsidy is still as high as 50 * (0.5 ^ 7) =
0.390625 btc/block

Although the orphan-block-probability cost for a miner to include an
extra transaction has been completely minimized, it is still not null.
Let's assume that while all these technical miracles were
happening...that 22 more years was enough for miners to realize this
fact, they have removed the special-cased-for-free-transaction policy
code that currently comes with Bitcoin Core (or it has been removed
from Bitcoin Core) and they don't mine transactions with fees lower
than 1 satoshi anymore.
<sarcasm>I hope this last assumption doesn't turn out to be more wild
than superluminal communication...</sarcasm>

But there must be a physical limit: in our example, miners will have
different CPU constraints (to further simplify, genetically-engineered
and super-fast memory also grows in the streets everywhere after an
accident in a Monsanto Lab; or better downloadmoreram.com actually
works and I just hadn't tried from windows or mac).

Miner A is able to process 100 M tx/block while miner B is only able
to process 10 M tx/block.

Will miner B be able to maintain itself competitive against miner B?

The answer is: it depends on the consensus maximum block size.
How so? Let's imagine that it has been completely removed.

Assuming a fee of 1 satoshi per transaction and no shortage of
unconfirmed transactions, miner A's block reward will be 0.390625 + 1
= 1.390625 btc vs miner B's 0.390625 + 0.1 = 0.390625 + 0.1 = 0.490625
btc.

Difficulty will tend to increase until the cost to produce a block
(including interest in all the capital needed, paid or not) is equal
to 1.390625 btc and therefore miner B will stop mining or go bankrupt.
But maybe 100 M and 10 M were too high numbers. What about 10 M and 1
M? Still, 0.400625 btc can't compete with 0.490625 btc.
You think 10x is too much of a difference? Fine, 2M vs 1M: still
0.400625 btc can't compete with 0.410625 btc

In summary, there will always be some physical limitation that may
benefit big mining players, so the block size maximum will always be
useful to limit mining centralization.
In other words (and I don't intend this to sound rude), if you want to
eventually remove the block size maximum consensus rule entirely, I
will never be able to agree with you: not even in your wildest dreams.

The paper models propagation using a single time value that is a 
function of block size.  Modeling the propagation distribution (which is 
totally separate from the poisson model of block production) would add a 
lot of complexity and my guess is the outcome would be little changed.

Why complicate the analysis by assuming that a miner who finds two 
blocks sequentially does not publish the first, or that other miners 
would orphan miner's first block unless both were very quick?  In 
general you don't consider anything beyond 1 block in the future, which 
seems fine.

Whether miners with larger value of h/H have a profit advantage, I'm not sure (but that was outside the scope of the paper anyways).

Correcting for non-orphaning of one's own blocks could be as simple as 
adding a factor (1 - h/H) to equation 4, which it appears would leave 
hashpower as an independent variable in the results.  But at worst, the 
discussion can be considered to apply directly only to low-hashpower 
miners right now.

Overall, the paper does not predict big changes to per/kb fees or spam 
costs for the kinds of block sizes being discussed for the immediate 
future (8MB).  But it does conclude that these fees will rise, not fall, 
with bigger blocks.

Also it is welcome that this paper actually mentions the bitcoin 
exchange rate as a factor in relation to block size (it points out that 
a spam attack is much more expensive in fiat terms today than it was 
years ago).

No, it depends on all of the variables that go into the mining
profitability equation.

Does miner B have access to cheaper electricity than miner A?
Access to more advanced mining hardware, sooner?
Ability to use excess heat generated from mining productively?
Access to inexpensive labor to oversee their operations?
Access to inexpensive capital to finance investment in hardware?

The number of fee-paying transactions a miner can profitably include in
their blocks will certainly eventually be part of that equation (it is
insignificant today), and that's fantastic-- we WANT miners to include lots
of transactions in their blocks.

This is a much more reasonable position. I wish this had been starting
point of this discussion instead of "the block size limit must be
increased as soon as possible or bitcoin will fail".
If the only fear about not increasing the block size fast enough is
that fees may rise, pieter wouldn't had to repeatedly explain that for
any reasonable block size some use case may fill the blocks rapidly.

This sounds good overall but I'm afraid you are oversimplifying some things.
Centralization pressure not only comes from global average bandwidth
costs and block propagation times is not the only concern.
Here's an extreme example: [1]
But anyway, yes, I agree, ANY metric would be better than nothing (the
current situation).

Given that for any non-absurdly-big size some transactions will
eventually be priced out, and that the consensus rule serves for
limiting mining centralization (and more indirectly centralization in
general) and not about trying to set a given average transaction fee,
I think the current level of mining centralization will always be more
relevant than the current fee level when discussing any change to the
consensus rule to limit centralization (at any point in time).
In other words, the question "can we change this without important
risks of destroying the decentralized properties of the system in the
short or long run?" should be always more important than "is there a
concerning rise in fees to motivate this change at all?".

As said, I would always consider the centralization risks first: I'd
rather have a $5/tx decentralized Bitcoin than a Bitcoin with free
transactions but effectively validated (when they validate blocks they
mine on top of) by around 10 miners, specially if only 3 of them could
easily collude to censor transactions [orphaning any block that
doesn't censor in the same manner]. Sadly I have no choice, the later
is what we have right now. And reducing the block size can't guarantee
that the situation will get better or even that fees could rise to
$5/tx (we just don't have that demand, not that it is a goal for
anyone). All I know is that increasing the block size *could*
(conditional, not necessarily, I don't know in which cases, I don't
think anybody does) make things even worse.

On the other hand, I could understand people getting worried if fees
where as high as $5/tx or even 20 cent/tx but we're very far away from
that case. How can low subsidies (a certainty) be "too far in the
future to worry about it" but $5/tx, 20 cent/tx or even 5 cent/tx an
urgent concern? For all I know, 5 cent/tx may not happen in the next
25 years: it may never happen. And if it happens, to me it will be a
symptom of Bitcoin success, even for others it means that Bitcoin has
become a "high value settlement network".
To the question

- At which minimum mining fee rate will you urge others to change the
consensus rules to increase the block size?

I'm very sorry, but my answer is:

- I honestly don't know, that may never happen.

What I can tell you is this: I will never be worried about "too high
fees" while the fees remain at 0 (null, zero, nothing, cero, nada,
zilch).
That's right, no matter what wallet's defaults chose for their users,
no matter what the minimum relay fee policy does to the "fee market"
and how much urgent transactions pay in fees; the fact remains that in
practice non-urgent transactions usually (when the raw transaction's
structure it's appropriate) don't have to pay fees.

I'm still missing an answer from the "big blocks size side" to the
following question (which I have insistently repeated with various
permutations):

If "not now" when will it be a good time to let fees rise above zero?
After the next subsidy halving? After 4 more subsidy halvings (ie
about 13 years from now, subsidy = 1.5625 btc/block )? After your
grandmother abandons her national currency and uses Bitcoin for
everything? Never?

ANY answer (maybe with the exception of the last one) would be less
worrying than silence.

I really appreciate your efforts to mediate in this dispute and I
honestly hope that my previous answer is useful as it is.

Just replace 1MB with ANY size.
But, yes, please, when will you consider a size to be too dangerous
for centralization?
Why 20 GB would have been safe but 21 GB wouldn't have been (or the
respective maximums and respective +1)?

Note that "Never, 20GB was just a number closer to infinity than 1MB
and I hoped that could had been voluntarily accepted by users. What I
really want is to completely remove this consensus rule forever." is a
perfectly valid answer. It just means that I will agree with people
that think this way as explained in [1] (yes, not even after
superluminal communication).

As an less relevant note, I feel extremely uncomfortable about being
included in the "1MB advocates" group. As I've tried to explain
several times, 1 is to me an arbitrary number like any other (at most,
the canonical arbitrary number), and so it is 1000000
(MAX_BLOCK_SIZE). I rarely like being grouped or labelled, but maybe
something more accurate like "not-recklessly-change-consensus-rules
advocates" would help.
There's nothing special about 1MB apart from being the current rule,
so I don't think the number is that much relevant to the discussion.
Grouping anyone that has raised any concern about rising the consensus
block size limit as "the 1MBers" is about as fair as grouping anyone
that has ever proposed a rise in the maximum size as "the 20GBers"
(specially when there's people that belong to both groups
simultaneously, like Pieter Wuille who started this thread, and whose
proposal we're supposed to be discussing).

Yes, of course.
I didn't say "it only depends", just "it depends".
The example is focused on CPU as the "centralizing factor".
And still, all costs are already included in the example:

"Difficulty will tend to increase until the cost to produce a block
(including interest in all the capital needed, paid or not) is equal
to [...]"

I'm focusing on gains but I didn't forget to subtract costs at the end.
I may have "weird" economic ideas, but that will usually just mean
that I mention "interest" in contexts where you may think it is not
relevant.
In other words, expect me to "sin" by excess rather than omission when
it comes to economic costs.

> Ability to use excess heat generated from mining productively?

I agree that mining profitability can radically change in this case
(ie a home heater miner is competing with other heaters, not with
other bitcoin miners).
But until such an economic breakthrough happens I would rather not
rely on it happening.
This could certainly change the mining centralization dynamics in a radical way.
Note that if I buy a heater for 20 usd and expect to mine 5 usd worth
of btc this winter, I will consider it cheaper than an
equivalently-energy-consuming non-mining heater sold for 16 usd.
Maybe next year a more mining-efficient heater will be sold that will
still mine 5 usd worth of btc in its first winter, while my old one
will only mine 0.5 usd the second winter. That's completely fine, it's
0.5 usd extra savings and I was already happy with 1 usd savings in
the first year!
This can be applied to small home heaters, full-building heaters...
Apparently the future doesn't look so bright when it comes to
industrial heating because higher temperatures are needed, but I'm
really optimistic about mining as a byproduct of human-heating
artifacts.
This would also mean that part of the total hashrate would travel the
globe with the winter, which would also have its own benefits (and
maybe new risks?) to decentralization.

When/If this happens, I think everybody should carefully reconsider
all their assumptions about mining centralization.
By "this", I mean production of mining devices whose primary purpose
it's not mining but rather heating (I don't think many people realize
about the huge economic consequences of this seemingly-small
difference, not even companies specialized in bitcoin mining ASIC
production).
It would also save me a lot of discussions with some ecologist friends
(the fact is that I'm much more worried about bitcoin's huge subsidies
on bitcoin's mining and what that means to the environment than I
usually let them know), but that's another topic...

At the same time we want mining to be (I was going to say "remain" but
I can't help with being pessimistic about the current mining
situation) decentralized, don't we?

B needs to sell ASICs and buy 90 M tx worth of CPU. 

Or, if you cap blocksize at 10 M tx, than A needs to sell the exact same
amount of CPU and buy the exact same amount of ASICs.

Either way, Miner A ends up with the ASIC cost equivalent of 90 M tx
worth of CPU in additional hashing advantage over B.  The centralization
has nothing to do with block size.  It has to do with Miner A having
more money than Miner B.

Alternatively, you might need to add a few more crazy assumptions.

It REALLY doesn't help the debate when you say patently false statements
like that.

My first blog post on this issue is here:
  http://gavinandresen.ninja/why-increasing-the-max-block-size-is-urgent

... and I NEVER say "Bitcoin will fail".  I say:

"If the number of transactions waiting gets large enough, the end result
will be an over-saturated network, busy doing nothing productive. I don?t
think that is likely? it is more likely people just stop using Bitcoin
because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable."

Mike sketched out the worst-case here:
  https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32

... and concludes:

"I believe there are no situations in which Bitcoin can enter an overload
situation and come out with its reputation and user base intact. Both would
suffer heavily and as Bitcoin is the founder of the cryptocurrency concept,
the idea itself would inevitably suffer some kind of negative
repercussions."


------------

So please stop with the over-the-top claims about what "the other side"
believe, there are enough of those (on both sides of the debate) on reddit.
I'd really like to focus on how to move forward, and how best to resolve
difficult questions like this in the future.

But you seem to consider that a bad thing. Maybe saying that you're
claiming that this equals Bitcoin failing is an exaggeration, but you do
believe that evolving towards an ecosystem where there is competition for
block space is a bad thing, right?

I don't agree that "Not everyone is able to use the block chain for every
use case" is the same thing as "People stop using Bitcoin". People are
already not using it for every use case.

Here is what my proposed BIP says: "No hard forking change that relaxes the
block size limit can be guaranteed to provide enough space for every
possible demand - or even any particular demand - unless strong
centralization of the mining ecosystem is expected. Because of that, the
development of a fee market and the evolution towards an ecosystem that is
able to cope with block space competition should be considered healthy."

No, competition for block space is good.

What is bad is artificially limiting or centrally controlling the supply of
that space.

So if we would have 8 MB blocks, and there is a sudden influx of users (or
settlement systems, who serve much more users) who want to pay high fees
(let's say 20 transactions per second) making the block chain inaccessible
for low fee transactions, and unreliable for medium fee transactions (for
any value of low, medium, and high), would you be ok with that? If so, why
is 8 MB good but 1 MB not? To me, they're a small constant factor that does
not fundamentally improve the scale of the system. I dislike the outlook of
"being forever locked at the same scale" while technology evolves, so my
proposal tries to address that part. It intentionally does not try to
improve a small factor, because I don't think it is valuable.

It's exactly as centrally limited as the finite supply of BTC - by
consensus. You and I may agree that a finite supply is a good thing, and
may disagree about whether a consensus rule about the block size is a good
idea (and if so, at what level), but it's a choice we make as a community
about the rules of the system we want to use.

Yes, that's fine. If the network cannot handle the transaction volume that
people want to pay for, then the marginal transactions are priced out. That
is true today (otherwise ChangeTip would be operating on-blockchain), and
will be true forever.

"better is better" -- I applaud efforts to fundamentally improve the
scalability of the system, but I am an old, cranky, pragmatic engineer who
has seen that successful companies tackle problems that arise and are
willing to deploy not-so-perfect solutions if they help whatever short-term
problem they're facing.

I think consensus is against you on that point.

I'm pretty sure that I can quote Mike Hearn with a sentence extremely
similar to that in this forum or in some of his blog posts (not in
https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32 at a first
glance...).
But yeah, what people said in the past is not very important: people
change their minds (they even acknowledge their mistake some times).
What interests me more it's what people think now.

I don't want to put words in your mouth and you are more than welcome
to correct what I think you think with what you really think.
All I'm trying to do is framing your fears properly.
If I say "all fears related to not raising the block size limit in the
short term can be summarized as a fear of fees rising in the short
term".
Am I correct? Am I missing some other argument?
Of course, problems that need to be solved regardless of the block
size (like an unbounded mempool) should not be considered for this
discussion.

If you pay high enough fees your transactions will be likely mined in
the next block.
So this seems to be reducible to the "fees rising" concern unless I am
missing something.

I think I would have a much better understanding of what "the other
side" thinks if I ever got an answer to a couple of very simple
questions I have been repeating ad nausea:

1) If "not now" when will it be a good time to let fees rise above zero?

2) When will you consider a size to be too dangerous for centralization?
In other words, why 20 GB would have been safe but 21 GB wouldn't have
been (or the respective maximums and respective +1 for each block
increase proposal)?

3) Does this mean that you would be in favor of completely removing

I've been insistently repeating this question too.
Admittedly, it would be a great disappointment if your answer to this
question is "yes": that can only mean that either you don't understand
how the consensus rule limits mining centralization or that you don't
care about mining centralization at all.

If you really want things to move forward, please, prove it by
answering these questions so that we don't have to imagine what the
answers are (because what we imagine is probably much worse than your
actual answers).
I'm more than willing to stop trying to imagine what "big block
advocates" think, but I need your answers from the "big block
advocates".

Asking repeatedly doesn't seem to be effective. So I will answer the
questions myself in the worse possible way I think a "big block
advocate" could answer them.
Feel free to replace my stupid answers with your own:

3) Does this mean that you would be in favor of completely removing

Yes, I would remove the rule because I don't care about mining centralization.

2) When will you consider a size to be too dangerous for centralization?

been (or the respective maximums and respective +1 for each block

Never, as said I don't care about mining centralization.
I thought users and Bitcoin companies would agree with a 20 GB limit
hardfork with proper lobbying, but I certainly prefer 21 GB.
>From 1 MB to infinity, the bigger the better, always.

1) If "not now" when will it be a good time to let fees rise above zero?

Never. Fees are just an excuse, the real goal is making Bitcoin centralized.

I'm quite confident that you will have better answers than those.
Please, let me know what you think.

The network can "handle" any size. I believe that if a majority of miners
forms SPV mining agreements, then they are no longer affected by the block
size, and benefit from making their blocks slow to validate for others (as
long as the fee is negligable compared to the subsidy). I'll try to find
the time to implement that in my simulator. Some hardware for full nodes
will always be able to validate and index the chain, so nobody needs to run
a pesky full node anymore and they can just use a web API to validate
payments.

Being able the "handle" a particular rate is not a boolean question. It's a
question of how much security, centralization, and risk for systemic error
we're willing to tolerate. These are not things you can just observe, so
let's keep talking about the risks, and find a solution that we agree on.

I don't believe there is a short-term problem. If there is one now, there
will be one too at 8 MB blocks (or whatever actual size blocks are
produced).

Maybe. But I believe that it is essential to not take unnecessary risks,
and find a non-controversial solution.

I don't believe that the maximum block size has much at all to do with
mining centralization, so I don't accept the premise of the question.

Whilst 1mb to 8mb might seem irrelevant from a pure computer science
perspective payment demand is not really infinite, at least not if by
"payment" we mean something resembling how current Bitcoin users use the
network.

If we define "payment" to mean the kind of thing that Bitcoin users and
enthusiasts have been doing up until now, then suddenly 1mb to 8mb makes a
ton of sense and doesn't really seem that small: we'd have to increase
usage by nearly an order of magnitude before it becomes an issue again!

If we think of Bitcoin as a business that serves customers, growing our
user base by an order of magnitude would be a great and celebration worthy
achievement! Not at all a small constant factor :)

And keeping the current user base happy and buying things is extremely
interesting, both to me and Gavin. Without users Bitcoin is nothing at all.
Not a settlement network, not anything.

It's actually going to be quite hard to grow that much. As the white paper
says, "the system works well enough for most transactions". And despite a
lot of effort by many people, killer apps that use Bitcoin's unique
features are still hit and miss. Perhaps Streamium, Lighthouse, ChangeTip,
some distributed exchange or something else will stimulate huge new demand
for transactions in future ..... but if so we're not there yet.

Gavin has answered this question in the clearest way possible -- in
tested C++ code, which increases capacity only on a precise schedule for
20 years, then stops increasing.

Message-ID: <CAKujSOFC+8DaGjpQ06iVkZGFUBnSs6fhW2aPFFJLXYoAJDbB2g@mail.gmail.com>

I am a long time Bitcoin user, miner, investor, full node operator, and
distributed real-time system software engineer.

Out of the all currently proposed blocksize increase solutions, I support
BIP101 (or something like it) and find the current blocksize debate very
frustrating, so I will try to systematically debunk some common arguments
against BIP101 below.

   1.

   We should not increase the blocksize because we'll just end up hitting
   the limit again at a future time.


   -

      If a reasonable blocksize increase like BIP101 that scales with
      technology is implemented, it's not a given that we will hit the
blocksize
      limit (consistently full blocks over an extended period of time) again in
      the future. Stating that we will definitely hit the blocksize limit again
      in the future is pure speculation about future bitcoin transaction volume
      that can't possibly be known at this time, and is nothing but conjecture.
      If technology increases faster than bitcoin transaction volume, simply
      scaling the Bitcoin blocksize could keep up with future demand.
If Bitcoin
      is successful beyond our wildest dreams and future transaction volume
      outstrips future blockchain space, alternative solutions like
sidechains or
      the lightning network will have more time to be implemented.


   1.

   The full node count will go down if we increase the blocksize because it
   will be more costly to run a full node.


   -

      I'm not sure this is true. I currently run a full node on a higher
      end consumer PC with a higher end home network connection, but if the
      blocksize limit is not raised and transaction fees increase such
that it is
      no longer economical for me to access the bitcoin blockchain directly, I
      will no longer run a full node to support the network. Bitcoin
is no longer
      interesting to me if it gets to the point where the average user
is priced
      off the blockchain. Users that have direct access to the blockchain are
      more likely to run full nodes. If Bitcoin ever becomes purely a limited,
      small settlement network, I will no longer support it and move onto
      something else.


   1.

   The blocksize can only be increased if there is developer ?consensus?
   and the change is not ?controversial?.


   -

      Any blocksize increase will the deemed ?controversial? and lack
      ?consensus?, but doing nothing in the face of consistently full
blocks and
      rising transaction fees is also ?controversial? and will lack
?consensus?.
      Inaction, maintaining the status quo, and blocking a blocksize
increase in
      the face of consistently full blocks and rising transaction fees
is just as
      controversial as increasing the blocksize.


   1.

   Don't increase the blocksize now with all the promising work going on
   with sidechains and the lightning network.


   -

      KISS (keep it simple, stupid). When dealing with a highly complex,
      mission critical system, there needs to be a very compelling reason to
      choose a much more complex solution over a simple solution like BIP101.
      Sidechains and the lightning network are much more complex than
BIP101 and
      introduce new points of failure. It's hard enough to get folks
to trust the
      Bitcoin network after 7 years, so it will likely take years until
      sidechains and the lightning network are proven enough to be trusted by
      users.


   1.

   Some miners will be at a disadvantage with larger blocks.


   -

      As folks have pointed out multiple times, network speed is just one
      of many variables that impact mining profitability. I don't believe for a
      second that every miner in China (57% of the network) would be negatively
      impacted by larger blocks because some of them either have decent network
      connections or connect to mining pools with decent network connections.
      Miners will be given ample notice of a blocksize increase before
it occurs,
      so they will have time to make plans to deal with larger blocks. More
      transactions per block should also increase miner profitability because
      more transactions equals more users equals more transaction fees!

In conclusion, I think the next year is a make or break year for Bitcoin
and hope the developers do everything they can to come up with a reasonable
long term growth plan to put Bitcoin in the best possible position to be
successful.

First of all, thank you very much for answering the questions, and
apologies for not having formulated them properly (fortunately that's
not an irreparable mistake).

When we talk about "fees" we're talking about different things. I
should have been more specific.
Average fees are greatly influenced by wallet and policy defaults, and
they also include extra fees that are included for fast confirmation.
I'm not talking about fast confirmation transactions, but about
non-urgent transactions.

What is the market minimum fee for miners to mine a transaction?

That's currently zero.
If you don't want to directly look at what blocks contain, we can also
use a fee estimator and define a "non-urgent period", say 1 week worth
of blocks (1008 blocks).
The chart in your link doesn't include a 1008 blocks line, but the 15
blocks (about 2.5 hours) line seems to already show zero fees:

http://img.svbtle.com/p4x3s7fn52sz9a.png

So I reformulate the question:

1) If "not now", when will it be a good time to let the "market
minimum fee for miners to mine a transaction" rise above zero?

This just shows where the 20 GB come from, not why you would reject 21 GB.
Let me rephrase.

2) Do you have any criterion (automatic or not) that can result in you
saying "no, this is too much" for any proposed size?
Since you don't think the consensus block size maximum limits mining
centralization (as you later say), it must be based on something else.
In any case, if you lack a criterion that's fine as well: it's never
too late to have one.
Would you agree that blocksize increase proposals should have such a
criterion/test?

Ok, this is an enormous step forward in the discussion, thank you.
In my opinion all discussions will be sterile while we can't even
agree on what are the positive effects of the consensus rule that
supposedly needs to be changed.

It's not that you don't care about centralization, it's that you don't
believe that a consensus block size maximum limits centralization at
all.
This means that if I can convince you that the consensus block size
maximum does in fact limit centralization in any way, you may change
your views about the whole blocksize consensus rule change, you may
even take back or change your own proposal.
But let's leave that aside that for now.

Regardless of the history of the consensus rule (which I couldn't care
less about), I believe the only function that the maximum block size
rule currently serves is limiting centralization.
Since you deny that function, do you think the (artificial) consensus
rule is currently serving any other purpose that I'm missing?

If the answer is something along the lines of "not really, it's just
technical debt", then I think you should be honest and consequent, and
directly advocate for the complete removal of the consensus rule.

I really think conversations can't really advance until we clarify the
different positions about the discussed consensus rule current
purpose.

Another question.

Did the "relay network" relay
0000000000000000009cc829aa25b40b2cd4eb83dd498c12ad0d26d90c439d99, the
BTC Nuggets block that was invalid post-softfork?  If so,

 - Is there reason to believe that by so doing, it contributed to the
growth of the 2015-07-04 fork?
 - Will the relay network at least validate block version numbers in the
future?

It already validates block version numbers.

It only relays valid transactions.

Although, the block relaying itself is explicitly "unvalidated" and
the software client can only usefully be used with a mempool
maintaining full node (otherwise it doesn't provide much value,
because the node must wait to validate the things). ... but that
doesn't actually mean no validation at all is performed, many
stateless checks are performed.

I don't know if Matt has an extensive writeup. But the basic
optimization it performs is trivial.  I wouldn't call it compression,
though it does have some analog to RTP "header compression".

All it does is relay transactions verified by a local node and keeps a
FIFO of the relayed transactions in both directions, which is
synchronous on each side.

When a block is recieved on either side, it replaces transactions with
their indexes in the FIFO and relays it along. Transactions not in the
fifo are escaped and sent whole. On the other side the block is
reconstructed using the stored data and handed to the node (where the
preforwarded transactions would have also been pre-validated).

There is some more than basic elaboration for resource management
(e.g. multiple queues for different transaction sizes)-- and more
recently using block templates to learn transaction priority be a bit
more immune to spam attacks, but its fairly simple.

Much better could be done about intelligently managing the queues or
efficiently transmitting the membership sets, etc.  It's just
basically the simplest thing that isn't completely stupid.

How many nodes are necessary to ensure sufficient network reliability? Ten,
a hundred, a thousand? At what point do we hit the point of diminishing
returns, where adding extra nodes starts to have negligible impact on the
overall reliability of the system?

It's not about reliability. There are plenty of nodes currently for
synchronization and other network functions.

It's about reduction of trust. Running a full node and using it verify your
transactions is how you get personal assurance that everyone on the network
is following the rules. And if you don't do so yourself, the knowledge that
others are using full nodes and relying on them is valuable. Someone just
running 1000 nodes in a data center and not using them for anything does
not do anything for this, it's adding network capacity without use.

That doesn't mean that the full node count (or the reachable full node
count even) are meaningless numbers. They are an indication of how hard it
is (for various reasons) to run/use a full node, and thus provide feedback.
But they are not the goal, just an indicator.

Two answers:

1. If you are willing to wait an infinite amount of time, I think the
minimum fee will always be zero or very close to zero, so I think it's a
silly question.

2. The "market minimum fee" should be determined by the market. It should
not be up to us to decide "when is a good time."

Sure, if keeping up with transaction volume requires a cluster of computers
or more than "pretty good" broadband bandwidth I think that's too far.
That's where original 20MB limit comes from, otherwise I'd have proposed a
much higher limit.

Although I've been very clear with my criterion, no, I don't think all
blocksize increase proposals should have to justify "why this size" or "why
this rate of increase." Part of my frustration with this whole debate is
we're talking about a sanity-check upper-limit; as long as it doesn't open
up some terrible new DoS possibility I don't think it really matters much
what the exact number is.

It prevents trivial denial-of-service attacks (e.g. I promise to send you a
1 Terabyte block, then fill up your memory or disk...).

And please read what I wrote: I said that the block limit has LITTLE effect
on MINING centralization.  Not "no effect on any type of centralization."

If the limit was removed entirely, it is certainly possible we'd end up
with very few organizations (and perhaps zero individuals) running full
nodes.

I partially agree. The community should decide what risks it is willing to
take, and set limits accordingly. Let the market decide how that space is
best used.

It is only a DoS protection limit if you want to rely on trusting miners. I
prefer a system where I don't have to do that.

But I agree the numbers don't matter much, for a different reason: the
market will fill up whatever space is available, and we'll have the same
discussion when the new limit doesn't seem enough anymore.

No, don't think so, the protocol is, essentially, relay transactions, when you get a block, send header, iterate over transactions, for each, either use two bytes for nth-recent-transaction-relayed, use 0xffff-3-byte-length-transaction-data. There are quite a few implementation details, and lots of things could be improved, but that is pretty much how it works.

No, just one queue, but it has a count-of-oversize-txn-limit, in addition to a size.

Except it doesn't really work :( (see https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/RelayNode/issues/12#issuecomment-128234446)

Patches welcome :) (read the issues list first... Rewriting the protocol from scratch is by far not the biggest win here).

The reason other miners mined on that fork is because they were watching each other's stratum servers, so the relay network should not have had a significant effect. Still, even in a different fork, miners already aggressively relay around the network/between each other, so I'm not so worried.

Really, thanks again for replying and not getting mad when I get your
thoughts wrong.
I believe that I've learned more about your position on the subject
today than in months of discussion and blogs (that's not a critique to
your blog post, it's just that they didn't answer to some questions
that I personally needed responded).

I'm very happy to have made the stupid question then. It has revealed
another big difference in the fundamental assumptions we're using.

My assumption is that for any reasonable size, free transactions will
eventually disappear (assuming Bitcoin doesn't "fail" for some other
reason).
Maybe I'm being too optimistic about the demand side of the market in
the long term.

In contrast, your assumption seems to be (and please correct me on
anything I get wrong) that...

"The limit will always be big enough so that free transactions are
mined forever. Therefore fees just allow users to prioritize their
urgent transactions and relay policies to protect their nodes against
DoS attacks.
Well, obviously, they also serve to pay for mining in a low-subsidy
future, but even with the presence of free transactions, fees will be
enough to cover mining costs, or a new mechanisms will be developed to
make a low-total-reward blockchain safe or expensive proof of work
will be replaced or complemented with something else that's cheaper.
The main point is that fees are not a mechanism to decide what gets
priced out of the blockchain, because advancements in technology will
always give as enough room for free transactions."
- jtimon putting words in Gavin's mouth, with the only intention to
understand him better.

I'm using "free transactions" even though you said "zero or very close to zero".
To you, "zero or very close to zero" may be the same thing, but to me
zero and very close to zero are like...different galaxies.
To me, entering the "very close to zero galaxy" is a huge step in the
development of the fee market.
I've been always assuming that moving from zero to 1 satoshi was
precisely what "big block advocates" wanted to avoid.
What they meant by "Bitcoin is going to become a high-value only
network" and similar things.
Knowing that for "big block advocates" zero and "very close to zero"
are equally acceptable changes things.

I completely agree, but the block size limit is a consensus rule that
doesn't adapt to the market. The market will adapt to whatever limit
is chosen by the consensus rules.

I would really like a more formal criterion, ideally automatic (like
any other test, the parameters can be modified as technology
advances).
But fair enough, even though your criterion is too vague or not
future-proof enough, I guess it is still a criterion.
It seems that this is a matter of disagreements and ideal ways of
doing things and not really a disagreement on fundamental assumptions.
So it seems this question wasn't so interesting after all.

That's what you think you are discussing, but I (and probably some
other people) think we are discussing something entirely different.
Because we have a fundamentally different assumption on what the block
size limit is about.
I really hope that identifying these "fundamental assumption
discrepancies" (FAD from now own) will help us avoid circular
discussions so that everything is less frustrating and more productive
for everyone.

This could be prevented in some other ways. If this is the only
concern, it doesn't need to be a consensus rule.

Sorry, another try:

You think the maximum block size rule serves to limit centralization
by limiting how hard it is to run a full node.
I agree with that, but I would add something more and you wouldn't:

The maximum block size consensus rule limits how hard it is to be a
competitive miner.

In other words, you think the last statement is false or incorrect.

Meta: I think we should try to collect and list more of this "FADs"
(we have at least 2 of them already). If you think it can be useful,
I'm more than happy to repeat this process in the opposite direction:
you make the questions and I give the answers, you write what you
think I think and I correct you in iterations. Probably we should
finish with you correcting what I think you think first. I am really
excited about understanding your point of view better.

Stupid humor (hopefully not out of context and not offensive): I'm
happy to discover that what I thought it was FUD was just FAD.
More seriously, I'm really happy for your interest in understanding
and being understood.
Let's worry about where do we think differently first and about who is
right on each point later.
In the end, only the conclusions on each point will matter and not who
claimed the final conclusions (in the points where we find them) first
(if we get to final common conclusions on that point at all).

I agree with you that decentralization is the most important feature of
Bitcoin, but I also think we need to think probabilistically and concretely
about when risks to decentralization are worthwhile.

Decentralization is not infinitely valuable in relation to low fees, just
like being alive is not infinitely valuable in relation to having money.
For instance, people will generally not accept a 100% probability of death
in exchange for any amount of money. However anyone who understands
probability and has the preferences of a normal person would play a game
where they accept a one in a billion chance of instant death to win one
billion dollars if they don't die.

Similarly we shouldn't accept a 100% probability of Bitcoin being
controlled by a single entity for any guarantee of cheap tx fees no matter
how low they are, but there should be some minuscule risk of
decentralization that we'd be willing to accept (like raising the block
size to 1.01 MB) if it somehow allowed us to dramatically increase
usability. (Imagine something like the Lightning Network but even better
was developed, but it could only work with 1.01 MB blocks).

I agree that we don't have good data about what exactly a 4 MB increase
would do. It sounds like you think the risks are too great / uncertain to
move from 1 MB to 4 MB blocks in the situation I described. I'm not clear
though on which specific risks you'd be most worried about at 4 MB, and if
there are any risks that you think don't matter at 4 MB but that you would
be worried about at higher block size levels. I also don't know if we have
similar ideas about the benefits of low tx fees. If we discussed exactly
how we were evaluating this scenario, maybe we'd discover that something I
thought was a huge benefit of low tx fees is actually not that compelling,
or maybe we'd discover that our entire disagreement boiled down to our
estimate of one specific risk.

For the record, I think these are the main harms of $5 tx fees, along with
the main risks I see from moving to 4 MB:

Fees of $5/tx would:
(a) Prevent a lot of people who could otherwise benefit from Bitcoin's
decentralization from having an opportunity to reap those benefits.
Especially people in poor countries with corrupt governments who could get
immediate benefit from it now.
(b) Prevent developers from experimenting with new Bitcoin use-cases, which
might eventually lead to helpful services.
(c) Prevent regular people from using Bitcoin and experimenting with it and
getting involved, because they think it's unusable for txns under many
hundreds of dollars in value, so it doesn't interest them. Not having the
public on our side could make us more vulnerable to regulators.

Changing the block size to 4 MB would:
(1) Probably reduce the number of full nodes by around 5%. Most of the drop
in full nodes over the past few years is probably due to Bitcoin Core being
used by fewer regular users for convenience reasons, but the extra HD space
required and extra bandwidth would probably make some existing people
running full nodes stop.
(2) Not hinder low bandwidth miners significantly, because of the relay
network.
(3) Not introduce any tx verification issues, because processors are fast
and tx processing is ridiculously cheap and we'd need way more than 4 MB of
txs for it to be a bottleneck.

So (1) is the only risk that gives me any significant concern, but I don't
think that the number of full nodes now is at a dangerous level.

Anyway, the point isn't for you and I to actually discuss this particular
hypothetical in more detail (although I would be curious to see similar
lists from you). I haven't studied the risks enough to actually put this
forth to the list as a good argument for what to do in this situation. My
main point is that being very specific and concrete both about our thought
process and about the hypothetical situation results in much better
discussions.

There's one more piece of information that I can give you which will help
you understand my position much better, and also force me to think really
carefully about this. It's the point at which I would switch to the other
side of the argument (either by varying the tx fee, or the block size). If
tx fees would only rise to 60 cents or lower if we stayed at 1 MB, then I
would be against a move to 4 MB. Or, keeping the hypothetical 1 MB fee at
$5, I think moving to 12 MB or higher is the point at which I'd switch over
to being a 1 MB advocate. Getting that same info from you tells me exactly
how you weigh the risks in a way that just listing the factors can't. In
this specific hypothetical scenario, what is the lowest block size increase
that you'd accept? It can be extremely low, like 1.01 MB. If you tell me
that you'd rather have $5 tx fees for the next year instead of changing the
block size to 1.01 MB, I would be really surprised.

Gavin is the only other person who I've seen who has defined at what block
size he'd switch to the other side (maybe not with a concrete number, but
with a rough range: the block size such that a normal person with a pretty
good connection couldn't run a full node).

I would say that in this case we know high tx fees could happen very soon
because there is a clear mechanism. Bitcoin just needs to become more
popular quickly for any number of reasons. Suppose the infrastructure for
remittances starts falling into place within the next two months, and
suddenly immigrants are clamoring to use Bitcoin to send money back to
their home countries. This could result in $5 tx fees very soon (not that I
think it's likely). Many of these immigrants would still use Bitcoin
because it's still better than the alternative for remittances, which would
price out a lot of people currently using Bitcoin for other reasons. As far
as I know, there is no plausible way that subsidies could plummet in
anywhere near that time frame, aside from the price of Bitcoin completely
collapsing. But if that happens in the near term (specifically, with very
low tx volume) a fee market won't help.

I would be extremely happy if Bitcoin could somehow sustain itself in the
long run with 5 cent tx fees. I'm optimistic about Lightning to handle the
cases where people need even cheaper txns.

Before I answer, here's my reasoning about why we don't need to worry about
a fee market now:

There is nothing particularly special about a fee market in Bitcoin. We
know how markets work, and we have no reason to suspect a fee market in
Bitcoin will have any new properties of markets that we can't foresee. When
demand becomes higher, there will be some equilibrium level of fee that
people have to pay to give a certain probability of inclusion within a
certain number of blocks. There will likely be some level of fee where if
you don't pay it, your tx will never be confirmed.

We have seen something like this working at various points in Bitcoin's
history. Look at the recent "stress tests." To get your tx confirmed in a
reasonable time frame, you had to bump your fee a little higher than the
txns from whoever was flooding the network. If you did, everything worked
fine. If you didn't, your tx didn't confirm (until the test ended, maybe?).
So there's nothing complicated here. It doesn't require a decade long
preparation to prove to ourselves that a fee market will work.

Unless in the future mining is funded mostly by charity (I think there's
only a 25% chance of that happening), we will need a fee market eventually.
I'd be fine if one developed now. I think 10 cents per txn right now
wouldn't be too bad, aside from the following reason. What concerns me
about insisting on a fee market right now is that usage is so small and the
block size is so limited that if demand increases just a little bit, fees
could skyrocket. It's not the 10 cent fees that would worry me, but what
they say about the potential for a huge spike. Fees could become $10 per tx
or higher very quickly. Yes, that would show that big organizations find
Bitcoin useful which is nice, but it'd also put decentralized money out of
reach of many other people. While Bitcoin still has a lot of growth ahead
of it, it's better to not set up roadblocks (for reasons other than
preserving decentralization) in front of that growth which will make things
very painful if that growth happens more suddenly than we expect.

I think the best argument for having a fee market right now is that if we
move to such a market suddenly in the future, wallets won't have time to
make the user experience good, and full nodes might not be written in such
a way that they gracefully handle a bunch of txns that might never confirm.
I don't think the required software changes are that complex though, so it
seems unnecessary to start adding friction for users now for something that
might be an issue in 10+ years.

So to answer your question: about two years before we think Bitcoin will
need to rely heavily on txn fees for security, I'd be in favor of adjusting
block size so that it resulted in enough total fees / security. Until that
point, we should care a lot about Bitcoin being widely used so that when we
do need a fee market, it's more like lots of people paying 5 cents per tx
instead of fewer people paying $10/tx. I think the former situation is much
more likely to sustainable, and we're more likely to get there if we
encourage low fee use cases now.

You've been arguing that 0 fee transactions will have to disappear someday,
but this isn't necessarily true. As long as enough people care about having
their txns confirm relatively quickly, there's no reason to make sure that
people who pay 0 fees never have their txns confirmed.

"Miners can do this unilaterally" maybe, if they are a closed group, based
on the 51% rule. But aren't they using full nodes for propagation?  In this
sense, anyone can vote by coding.

If and when we need to vote, a pair-wise runoff ("condorcet method") will
find an option that is championed by a majority over each other option.
There may not be any such option, in which case no change would make the
most sense.

The voting proposal has several appeals to authority (which no one has)
like "People with certain amount of contribution" and "Exchanges operated
for at least 1 year with 100,000BTC 30-day volume may also apply": who
decided what amount or whether or not the application is approved?  It also
doesn't specify how many btc equates to one vote.

They don't need to use full nodes for propagation. Miners don't care when
other full nodes hear about their blocks, only whether they (eventually)
accept them.

And yes, full nodes can change what blocks they accept. That's called a
hard fork :)

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size implementation using Game Theory
Message-ID: <CAOvA3_hhzWqX0k7xbua=qFptb90fkbCU-WDMih4=mX+kRrWG1g@mail.gmail.com>

Bitcoin is built on game theory. Somehow we seem to have forgotten that and
are trying to fix our "block size issue" with magic numbers, projected
percentage growth of bandwidth speeds, time limits, etc... There are
instances where these types of solutions make sense, but this doesn't
appear to be one of them. Lets return to game theory.

Proposal: Allow any miner to, up to, double the block size at any given
time - but penalize them. Using the normal block reward, whatever
percentage increase the miner makes over the previous limit is taken from
both the normal reward and fees. The left over is rewarded to the next
miner that finds a block.

If blocks stay smaller for an extended period of time, it goes back down to
the previous limit/ x amount decrease/% decrease  (up for debate)

Why would this work?: Miners only have incentive to do raise the limit when
they feel there is organic growth in the network. Spam attacks, block bloat
etc would have to be dealt with as it is currently. There is no incentive
to raise the size for spam because it will subside and the penalty will
have been for nothing when the attack ends and block size goes back down.

I believe it would have the nice side effect of forcing miners to hold the
whole block chain. I believe SPV does not allow you to see all the
transactions in a block and be able to calculate if you should be adding
more to your reward transaction if the last miner made the blocks bigger.
Because of this, the miners would also have an eye on blockchain size and
wont want it getting huge too fast (outsize of Moore's law of Nielsen's
Law). Adding to the gamification.

This system would encourage block size growth due to organic growth and the
penalty would encourage it to be slow as to still keep reward high and
preserve ROE.

What this would look like: The miners start seeing what looks like natural
network growth, and make the decision (or program an algorithm, the beauty
is it leaves the "how" up to the miners) to increase the blocksize. They
think that, in the long run, having larger blocks will increase their
revenue and its worth taking the hit now for more fees later. They increase
the size to 1.25 MB. As a result, they reward would be 18.75 (75%). The
miner fees were .5BTC. The miner fees are also reduced to .375BTC. Everyone
who receives that block can easily calculate 1) if the previous miner gave
themselves the proper reward 2) what the next reward should be if they win
it. Miners now start building blocks with a 31.25 reward transaction and
miner fee + .125.

I think the key is comity and humility in terms of being honest about our inability to predict future trends in a meaningful way while passing through scrutiny coming from divergent perspectives. ?8MB + 40% annually (at whatever increase frequency is preferred, at coinbase halvings seems most ideal) is the proposal to use.

What if 40% is too fast? ??
If 40% turns out to be excessive, miners have a built in incentive to cap their blocks at a lower amount that meets the supply / demand equilibrium vs. the price of bitcoin trading on the free market. ? The key here is to understand ?price of bitcoin on the free market?. ?Most developers don?t understand free market economics beyond gambling, which is a good bit of the problem here. ?

Bottom line is, miners directly benefit from higher bitcoin prices when denominated in other currencies. ?This fact will naturally limit excessive growth of blk*.dat. size, because if the storage requirements for bitcoin grow out of reach of amateurs, it will lead to excessive centralization and capture by powerful interests, which would threaten to convert bitcoin to a form of sovereign currency and kill free demand for bitcoin (and tank the price). ?Miners don?t want that without some other body paying them to make econonically distorted decisions. ?They will limit the size themselves if they see this as an emerging threat. ?It?s in their best interests and will keep them in business longer.

Now, is there a risk that some excessively well funded entity could artificially inflate the price of bitcoin while this bribing miners to let blk*.dat size grow out of hand (distorting miner economics) in some sort of ?subsidies for increased liquidity? corruption scheme? ?No there isn?t, because we are going to have a cap on the size that is reasonable enough that we know it won?t force out any amateurs for at least 5 years, and likely longer.

What if 40% is too slow?
That?s a problem anyone who actually owns bitcoin would like to have. ?We?ll gladly support an increase in the rate if demand supports it later with a subsequent change. ?We?ll have to do this eventually anyway when SHA256 and RIPEMD160 exhibit collisions, or some other non-self imposed existential threat rears its head.

Long game
Now, this entire scheme is predicated on the price going higher over the extended term. ?I would argue that if we are doing a good job, the price should go higher. ?Isn?t that the best barometer of performance? ?Demand for the scarce units inside the protocol denominated in other currencies?

8MB is 1MB + 40% a year from January 2009 to today. ?40% a year is as good as we are going to get in terms of our extrapolated estimation of future ability to host full nodes. ?Anything else is overengineering something we can?t predict anyway. ?Any arguments against this setting and rate of growth that aren?t exclusively focused on the computer science side of the debate are misguided at best, and corrupted by competing incentives at worst. ?This is because it?s not possible to predict the future any better than using an extrapolation of the past, which is exactly what 8MB + 40% represents.

So TLDR? ?Go with 8MB + 40% annually and we will cross any (likely imaginary) bridges when we come to them down the road.

They don't need to use full nodes for propagation. Miners don't care when other full nodes hear about their blocks, only whether they (eventually) accept them.

And yes, full nodes can change what blocks they accept. That's called a hard fork :)

The equilibrium for that game is just keeping the same block size, isn't
it? Assume there's a huge backlog of fee-paying transactions, such that you
can trivially fill 1MB, and easily fill 1.25MB for the forseeable future;
fee per MB is roughly stable at "f". Then at any point in time, a miner has
the choice between receiving 25 + f btc, or increasing the blocksize to 1+p
MB and earning (25+f+pf) * (1-p) = f-ppf = 25(1-p) + f(1-pp) < 25+f. Even
if you think bigger blocks are good long term, wouldn't you reason that
other people will think so too, so why pay the price for it yourself,
instead of waiting for someone else to pay it and just reaping the benefit?


An idea I've been pondering is having the block size adjustable in
proportion to fees being paid. Something like "a block is invalid if
a(B-c)*B > F" where B is the block's size, F is the total fees for the
block, and a and c are scaling parameters -- either hardcoded in bitcoin,
or dynamically adjusted by miner votes. ATM, bitcoin's behavour is
effectively the same as setting c=1MB, a>=21M BTC/byte.

Having a more reasonable value for a would make it much easier to produce a
fee market for bitcoin transactions -- if the blocksize is currently around
some specific "B", then the average cost per byte of a transaction is just
"a(B-c)". If you pay more than that, then a miner will include your txn
sooner, increasing the blocksize beyond average if necessary; if you pay
less, you may have to wait for a lull in transactions so that the blocksize
ends up being smaller than average and miners can afford to include your
transaction (or someone might send an unnecessarily high fee paying txn
through, and yours might get swept along with it).

To provide some real numbers, you need to make some assumptions on fee
levels. If you're happy with:

 - 1 MB blocks are fine, even if no one's paying any fees
 - if people are paying 0.1 mBTC / kB (=0.1 BTC/MB) in fees on average then
8MB is okay

then a(1-c)=0, so c=1MB, and a(8-1)=0.1, so a=0.0143 and the scaling works
out like:

 - 1MB blocks: free transactions, no fees
 - 2MB blocks: 0.0143 mBTC/kB, 0.02 btc in fees/block
 - 4MB blocks: 0.043 mBTC/kB, 0.17 btc in fees/block
 - 8MB blocks: 0.1 mBTC/kB, 0.8 btc in fees/block
 - 20MB blocks: 0.27 mBTC/kB, 5.4 btc in fees/block
 - 40MB blocks: 0.56 mBTC/kB, 22 btc in fees/block

In the short term, miners can just maximise fees for a block -- ie, add the
highest fee/byte txns in order until adding the next one would invalidate
the block.

Over the long term, you'd still want to be able to adjust a and c -- as the
price of bitcoin in USD/real terms goes up, a should decrease
proportionally; as hardware/software improve, a should decrease and/or c
should increase.  Essentially miners would want to choose a,c such that the
market for block space clears at a price of some $x/byte, where $x is
determined by their costs -- ie, hardware/software constraints. If they set
a too high, or c too low, then they'll be unable to accept some
transactions offering $x/byte, and thus lose out. If they set a too low or
c too high, they'll be mining bigger blocks for less reward, and lose out
that way too. At the moment, I think it's a bit of both problems -- c is
too low (meaning some transactions get dropped), but a is too high (meaning
fees are too low to pay for the effort of bigger blocks).

Note that, as described, miners could try cheating this plan by making a
high fee transaction to themselves but not publishing it -- they'll collect
the fee anyway, and now they can mine arbitrarily large blocks. You could
mitigate this by having a(B-c) set the /minimum/ fee/byte of every
transaction in a block, or alternatively by enforcing each miner pay a
significant %ge of collected fees to the miner of the next block(s).

?Cheers,
aj?

It won't work as you thought. If a miner has 95% of hashing power, he 
would have 95% of chance to find the next block and collect the penalty. 
In long term, he only needs to pay 5% penalty. It's clearly biased 
against small miners.

Instead, you should require the miners to burn the penalty. Whether this 
is a good idea is another issue.

Your proposal fails here:
"If the block defined in the Guarantee Message has not been shown"

What is blockchain? You can see blockchain as a mechanism to prove 
something has been shown by certain order. Therefore, it is not possible 
to prove something has not been shown with blockchain.

Your proposal works only with a centralized trusted party.

Popping this into it's own thread:

Which Jorge misinterpreted to mean that I think there will always be at
least one miner willing to mine a transaction for free.

That's not what I'm thinking. It is just an observation based on the fact
that blocks are found at random intervals.

Every once in a while the network will get lucky and we'll find six blocks
in ten minutes. If you are deciding what transaction fee to put on your
transaction, and you're willing to wait until that
six-blocks-in-ten-minutes once-a-week event, submit your transaction with a
low fee.

All the higher-fee transactions waiting to be confirmed will get confirmed
in the first five blocks and, if miners don't have any floor on the fee
they'll accept (they will, but lets pretend they won't) then your
very-low-fee transaction will get confirmed.

In the limit, that logic becomes "wait an infinite amount of time, pay zero
fee."

So... I have no idea what the 'market minimum fee' will be, because I have
no idea how long people will be willing to wait, how many times they'll be
willing to retransmit a low-fee transaction that gets evicted from
memory-limited memory pools, or how much memory miners will be willing to
dedicate to storing transactions that won't confirm for a long time because
they're waiting for a flurry of blocks to be found.

That's only the case when the actual rate of transactions with a non-zero
fee is below what fits in blocks. If the total production rate is higher,
even without configured floor by miners, a free transaction won't ever be
mined, as there will always be some backlog of non-free transaction. Not
saying that this is a likely outcome - it would inevitably mean that people
are creating transactions without any guarantee that they'll be mined,
which may not be what anyone is interested in. But perhaps there is some
"use" for ultra-low-priority unreliable transactions (... despite DoS
attacks).

Fair enough, I don't think anyone knows.

I guess my question (and perhaps that's what Jorge is after): do you feel
that blocks should be increased in response to (or for fear of) such a
scenario. And if so, if that is a reason for increase now, won't it be a
reason for an increase later as well? It is my impression that your answer
is yes, that this is why you want to increase the block size quickly and
significantly, but correct me if I'm wrong.

I think there are multiple reasons to raise the maximum block size, and
yes, fear of Bad Things Happening as we run up against the 1MB limit is one
of the reasons.

I take the opinion of smart engineers who actually do resource planning and
have seen what happens when networks run out of capacity very seriously.


And if so, if that is a reason for increase now, won't it be a reason for

Sure, it might be a reason for an increase later. Here's my message to
in-the-future Bitcoin engineers:  you should consider raising the maximum
block size if needed and you think the benefits of doing so (like increased
adoption or lower transaction fees or increased reliability) outweigh the
costs (like higher operating costs for full-nodes or the disruption caused
by ANY consensus rule change).

You make a logical fallacy;

I would agree that nodes are there for people to stop trusting someone that 
they have no trust-relationship with.

But your conclusion that low node count is an indication that its hard to run 
one discards your own point.  You forget the point that running a node is only 
needed if you don't know anyone you can trust to run it for you.  I'm pretty 
darn sure that this will have a bigger effect on nodecount than how hard it 
is.
Or, in other words, without a need to run a node you can't judge the 
difficulty of why there aren't more running.

This is a very political answer; it doesn't actually say anything since 
'unnecessary' is a personal judgment. Everyone will agree with you, but that 
doesn't mean anything.

On the other hand, things like the Raspberry PI and similar hardware are 
gaining ground fast. And they can run a node just fine.
I have many friends that run such small hardware for things like Owncloud.org 
because it is decentralized.  When Bitcoin gets traction with these people, I 
have no doubt a nice portion of them will run a node for the same reason they 
are running their private cloud. Trust No One.

Or, in other words, when Bitcoin grows in popularity and more people find it 
interesting (and we fix longstanding issues in Core), the desktop node that 
eventually get shut down will be replaced with the next generation hardware of 
a different kind of Bitcoin user.

This is a fundamental disagreement then. I believe that the demand is
infinite if you don't set a fee minimum (and I don't think we should), and
it just takes time for the market to find a way to fill whatever is
available - the rest goes into off-chain systems anyway. You will run out
of capacity at any size, and acting out of fear of that reality does not
improve the system. Whatever size blocks are actually produced, I believe
the result will either be something people consider too small to be
competitive ("you mean Bitcoin can only do 24 transactions per second?"
sounds almost the same as "you mean Bitcoin can only do 3 transactions per
second?"), or something that is very centralized in practice, and likely
both.

In general that sounds reasonable, but it's a dangerous precedent to make
technical decisions based on a fear of change of economics...

If the incentives for running a node don't weight up against the
cost/difficulty using a full node yourself for a majority of people in the
ecosystem, I would argue that there is a problem. As Bitcoin's fundamental
improvement over other systems is the lack of need for trust, I believe
that with increased adoption should also come an increased (in absolute
terms) incentive for people to use a full node. I'm seeing the opposite
trend, and that is worrying IMHO.

You clearly indicated that node count is an indicator of how hard it is to run 
a node.
Thats like saying something is too expensive because we don't sell enough. It 
forgets to ask the question of need. Do people want it.

Like in our case the need to run a node in the first place.

And you do the same thing again; you dismiss the need factor.

Most merchants have no need for a node, most miners don't even want to run one 
anymore. Users don't make a significant amount of payments to care.

Any conclusions with regards to difficulty of running a node based on max-
blocksize is speculation without numbers; the only numbers you have is 
historical node count, and they don't mean shit because the need has not 
grown.
For instance, merchants are told to trust someone like bitpay.


Historical node-count says nothing. Anyone using it for the blocksize debate 
is speculating without basis.

Of course there is a need. It's the primary mechanism that keeps Bitcoin
secure and immune from malicious influence.

Of course not everyone needs to run a node. But that leaves the
responsibility on us - the community - to help the situation by not making
it too hard to run a node. And I see the block size as the primary way
through which we do that.

If the impact of the system goes us, so should the - joint - incentives to
keep it secure. And I think we're (slowly) failing at that.

When "the network runs out of capacity" (when we hit the limit) do we
expect anything to happen apart from minimum market fees rising (above
zero)?
Obviously any consequences of fees rising are included in this concern.

Interesting position there Peter...you fear more people actually using
bitcoin.  The less on chain transactions the lower the velocity and the
lower the value of the network.  I would be careful what you ask for
because you end up having nothing left to even root the security of these
off chain transactions with and then neither will exist.

Nobody ever said you wouldn't run out of capacity at any size.  It's quite
the fallacy to draw the conclusion from that statement that block size
should remain far below a capacity it can easily maintain which would bring
more users/velocity/value to the system.  The outcomes of both of those
scenarios are asymmetric.  A higher block size can support more users and
volume.

Raising the blocksize isn't out of fear.  It's the realization that we are
at a point where we can raise it and support more users and transactions
while keeping the downsides to a minimum (centralization etc).

Are you saying that unless the majority of people in the ecosystem decide
to trust nothing but the genesis block hash (decide to run a full node)
there is a problem?

If so, then we do have a fundamental difference of opinion, but I've
misunderstood how you think about trust/centralization/convenience
tradeoffs in the past.

I believe people in the Bitcoin ecosystem will choose different tradeoffs,
and I believe that is OK-- people should be free to make those tradeoffs.

And given that the majority of people in the ecosystem were deciding that
using a centralized service or an SPV-level-security wallet was better even
two or three years ago when blocks were tiny (I'd have to go back and dig
up number-of-full-nodes and number-of-active-wallets at the big web-wallet
providers, but I bet there were an order of magnitude more people using
centralized services than running full nodes even back then), I firmly
believe that block size has very little to do with the decision to run a
full node or not.

Anecdotally I've seen two primary reasons posed for not running a node:

1) For enthusiasts who want to altruistically run a node at home, it's
usually a bandwidth / quality of service problem. There are tools to help
work around this, but most users aren't sysadmins and would prefer a simple
configuration option in bitcoind and a slider / selector in the QT client
to throttle the total bandwidth usage. This issue has been open for years:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/273 - if you want to make it
easier for enthusiasts to run nodes, I'd start there.

2) For businesses, it's not so much an issue with the resources of
installing / running / maintaining a node, it's an issue with the lack of
indexing options offered by bitcoind. Thus the business will also need to
run their own indexing solution - an out-of-the-box solution such as
Insight or Toshi might work, but for more custom indexing you have to roll
your own software - this is where it actually becomes expensive.

Depending upon the query volume / latency needs of the business, it may not
make sense to bother administering bitcoind instances, the indexing
software, and its databases - using a third party API will probably be more
efficient.

I shouldn't have said majority, sorry. But I do believe that as the odds at
stake in the system go up, so should those who take an interest in
verifying. That doesn't seem to be the case, and is a problem, where that
is a result of the block chain size or not.

I agree. Though I believe that the blockchain itself cannot offer many
tradeoffs, and by trying to make it scale we hurt the whole system. The
place to introduce tradeoffs is in layers on top - there you can build
systems with various levels of trust without hurting others.

> And given that the majority of people in the ecosystem were deciding that
using a centralized service or an SPV-level-security wallet was better even
two or three years ago when blocks were tiny (I'd have to go back and dig
up number-of-full-nodes and number-of-active-wallets at the big web-wallet
providers, but I bet there were an order of magnitude more people using
centralized services than running full nodes even back then).

That's inevitable, I'm sure.

> I firmly believe that block size has very little to do with the decision
to run a full node or not.

Within certain limits, maybe not. Within certain limits, maybe it also does
not incentivize trusted miner setups like SPV mining (which hurt the
security of SPV nodes tremendously).

But if the reason for increasing is because you fear a change of economics,
then it means you prefer not dealing with that change. I believe you prefer
not dealing with it ever, and would rather have a system where as much as
possible happens on-chain, even when we unknowingly go beyond those limits.
I think we don't do the ecosystem a service by promising that such a future
is possible without compromises.

So, I think the block size should follow technological evolution, and not
reenforce the belief that the block size should follow demand. There will
always be demand, and we should learn to deal with it.

What if we reduce the block size to 0.125MB? That will allow 0.375tx/s. 
If 3->24 sounds "almost the same", 3->0.375 also sounds almost the same. 
We will have 50000 full nodes, instead of 5000, since it is so 
affordable to run a full node.

If 0.125MB sounds too extreme, what about 0.5/0.7/0.9MB? Are we going to 
have more full nodes?

No, I'm not trolling. I really want someone to tell me why we 
should/shouldn't reduce the block size. Are we going to have more or 
less full nodes if we reduce the block size?

?That depends a bit on how ra?tional miners are, doesn't it? Once the block
subsidy is retired, hashpower is only paid for by fees -- and if there's no
fee paying transactions in the queue, then there's no reward for applying
hashpower, so mining a block won't even pay for your costs. In that case,
better to switch to hatching something else (an altcoin with less fees than
bitcoin has on average but more than nothing, eg), or put your hashing
hardward into a low power mode so you at least cut costs.

That will only be needed for a short while though -- presumably enough
transactions will come in in the next five or ten minutes for a block to be
worth mining again, so maybe implementing that decision process is more
costly than the money you'd save.

?(C?
onversely, when the queue is over-full because there's been no blocks found
for a while, that should mean you can fill a block with higher-than-average
fee transactions, so I'd expect some miners to switch hashpower from
altcoins and sidechains to catch the temporary chance of higher revenue
blocks.
?Both tendencies would help reduce the variance in block time, compared to
a steady hashrate, which would probably be a good thing for the network as
a whole)?


I think the same incentives apply with mining being paid for by assurance
contracts rather than directly by transaction fees -- if you get a bunch of
blocks done quickly, the existing assurance contracts are dealt with just
as well as if it had taken longer; so you want to wait until new ones come
in rather than spend your hashpower for no return.

?All of this only applies once fees make up a significant portion of the
payment for mining a block, though.?

Cheers,
aj

Please don't put words into Pieter's mouth. I guarantee you everyone
working on Bitcoin in their heart of hearts would prefer everyone in the
world being able to use the Bitcoin ledger for whatever purpose, if there
were no cost.

But like any real world engineering issue, this is a matter of tradeoffs.
At the extreme it is simply impossible to scale Bitcoin to the terrabyte
sized blocks that would be necessary to service the entire world's
financial transactions. Not without sacrificing entirely the protection of
policy neutrality achieved through decentralization. And as that is
Bitcoin's only advantage over traditional consensus systems, you would have
to wonder what the point of such an endeavor would be.

So *somewhere* you have to draw the line, and transactions below that level
are simply pushed into higher level or off-chain protocols.

The issue, as Pieter and Jorge have been pointing out, is that technical
discussion over where that line should be has been missing from this debate.

Some arguments have floated around that even in the absence of "causing an
increase in the number of full nodes", that a reduction of the max block
size might be beneficial for other reasons, such as bandwidth saturation
benefits. Also less time spent validating transactions because of the fewer
transactions.

That's a good question.

An argument has been put forward that a larger block size would reduce
the security of the network, so does the converse hold?

Yes, I see this as correct as well.  If demand for space within a particular block is elevated (e.g., when the network has not found a block for 30 minutes), the minimum fee density for inclusion will be greater than the minimum fee density when demand for space is low (e.g., when the network has found several blocks in quick succession, as Gavin pointed out).  Lower-fee paying transaction will just wait to be included at one of the network lulls where a bunch of blocks were found quickly in a row.  

The feemarket.pdf paper ( https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf ) shows that this will always be the case so long as the block space supply curve (i.e., the cost in BTC/byte to supply additional space within a block [rho]) is a monotonically-increasing function of the block size (refer to Fig. 6 and Table 1).  The curve will satisfy this condition provided the propagation time for block solutions grows faster than log Q where Q is the size of the block.  Assuming that block solutions are propagated across physical channels, and that the quantity of pure information communicated per solution is proportional to the amount of information contained within the block, then the communication time will always grow asymptotically like O(Q) as per the Shannon-Hartely theorem, and the fee market will be healthy.  

Best regards,
Peter

 Mid-Year 2015 report
Message-ID: <b0813349d690442d6ef3961748d1c9fb@openbitcoinprivacyproject.org>

Hi,

Hope it is OK to post this on the list, was not sure where else to post 
for answers from Bitcoin-Qt client developers.

As part of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project?s ongoing wallet privacy 
measurement efforts, we?ve selected the Bitcoin-Qt client v0.11.0 for 
inclusion into our 2015 mid year survey.

While our volunteers will be performing a series of functional tests by 
interacting with your application directly, several of the features we?d 
like to examine are not easily discernible by non-developers, and for 
this reason we?re asking for your help.

If you can answer the following questions about your wallet?s behavior 
it will assist us with the process of accurately rating your wallet?s 
privacy features.

	Transaction Formatting

1.	Does your application take any steps to create ambiguity between 
transactions which unavoidably spend from multiple addresses at the same 
time and intentional mixing transactions?
2.	What algorithms does your application use for ordering inputs and 
outputs in a transaction? In particular, how do you handle the change 
output and do you take into account common practices of other wallet 
applications when determining ordering?
3.	Does your application minimize the harmful effects of address reuse 
by spending every spendable input (?sweeping?) from an address when a 
transaction is created?
4.	Does your application fully implement BIP 62?

Mixing

5.	If your application supports mixing:
a.	What is the average number of participants a user can expect to 
interact with on a typical join transaction?
b.	Does your application attempt to construct join transactions in a way 
that avoids distinguishing them from non-join transactions?
c.	Does your application perform any kind of reversibility analysis on 
join transactions prior to presenting them to the user for confirmation?
d.	Is the mixing technique employed secure against correlation attacks 
by the facilitator, such as a CoinJoin server or off-chain mixing 
service?
e.	Is the mixing technique employed secure against theft of funds by the 
facilitator or its participants?

Donations

6.	If your application has a fee or donation to the developers feature:
a.	What steps do you take to make the donations indistinguishable from 
regular spend in terms of output sizes and destination addresses?

Balance Queries and Tx Broadcasting

7.	Please describe how your application obtains balance information in 
terms of how queries from the user?s device can reveal a connection 
between the addresses in their wallet.
a.	Does the application keep a complete copy of the blockchain locally 
(full node)?
b.	Does the user?s device provide a filter which matches some fraction 
of the blockchain while providing a false positive rate (bloom or prefix 
filters)?
i.	If so, approximately what fraction of the blockchain does the filter 
match in a default configuration (0% - 100%)?
c.	Does the user?s device query all of their addresses at the same time?
d.	Does the user?s device query addresses individually in a manner that 
does not allow the query responder to correlate queries for different 
addresses?
e.	Can users opt to obtain their balance information via Tor (or 
equivalent means)?
8.	Does the applications route outgoing transactions independently from 
the manner in which it obtains balance information? Can users opt to 
have their transactions submitted to the Bitcoin network via Tor (or an 
equivalent means) independently of how they obtain their balance 
information?
9.	If your application supports multiple identities/wallets, does each 
one connect to the network as if it were completely independent from the 
other?
a.	Does the application ever request balance information for addresses 
belonging to multiple identities in the same network query?
b.	Are outgoing transactions from multiple identities routed 
independently of each other to the Bitcoin network?
c.	When an identity/wallet is deleted, does the deletion process 
eliminate all evidence from the user's device that the wallet was 
previously installed?

	Network Privacy

10.	When a user performs a backup operation for their wallet, does this 
generate any automatic network activity, such as a web query or email?
11.	Does your application perform any lookup external to the user?s 
device related to identifying transaction senders or recipients?
12.	Does you application connect to known endpoints which would be 
visible to an ISP, such as your domain?
13.	If your application connects directly to nodes in the Bitcoin P2P 
network, does it either use an unremarkable user agent string (Bitcoin 
Core. BitcoinJ, etc), or randomize its user agent on each connection?

	Physical Access

14.	Does the application uninstall process for your application 
eliminate all evidence from the user's device that the application was 
previously installed? Does it also eliminate wallet data?
15.	Does your application use techniques such as steganography to store 
persistent wallet metadata in a form not identifiable as belong to a 
Bitcoin wallet application?
16.	Please describe the degree to which users can use passwords/PINs to 
protect their data:
a.	Can the user set a password/PIN to protect their private keys?
b.	Can the user set a password/PIN to protect their public keys and 
balance information?
c.	Can the user set a password/PIN to encrypt other wallet metadata, 
such as address books and transaction notes?
d.	Does the application use a single password/PIN to cover all protected 
data, or does it allow the use of multiple passwords/PINs?

Custodianship

17.	Do you as a wallet provider ever have access to unencrypted copies 
of the user?s private keys, public keys, or any other wallet metadata 
which may be used to associate a user with their transactions or 
balances?

	Telemetry Data

18.	If your application reports telemetry data, such as usage 
information or automatic crash reporting, does the user have the 
opportunity to review and approve all information transmitted before it 
is sent?

	Source Code and Building

19.	Can a user of your application compile the application themselves in 
a manner that produces a binary version identical to the version you 
distribute (deterministic build system)?

Thank you for assisting us with this effort to measure privacy progress 
in the Bitcoin wallet space.  If at all possible, please return this 
survey before 2015/08/13 to ensure the score for your application will 
be as accurate as possible.

Who said anything about scaling bitcoin to visa levels now?  We're talking
about an increase now that scales into the future at a rate that is
consistent with technological progress.

Peter himself said "So, I think the block size should follow technological
evolution...".

The blocksize increase proposals have been modeled around this very thing.
It's reasonable to increase the blocksize to a point that a reasonable
person, with reasonable equipment and internet access can run a node or
even a miner with acceptable orphan rates.  Most miners are spv mining
anyways.  The 8 or even 20 MB limits are within those parameters.

These are not mutually exclusive.  We can design an increase to blocksize
that addresses both demand exceeding the available space AND follow
technological evolution.  Peter's latest proposal is way too conservative
on that front.

Clarification...

These are not mutually exclusive.  We can design an increase to blocksize
that increases available space on chain AND follow technological
evolution.  Peter's latest proposal is way too conservative on that front.

And given Peter's assertion that demand is infinite there will still be a
an ocean of off chain transactions for the likes of blockstream to address.

Surely you have some sort of empirical measurement demonstrating the
validity of that statement? That is to say you've established some
technical criteria by which to determine how much centralization pressure
is too much, and shown that Pieter's proposal undercuts expected progress
in that area?

Peter's proposal undercuts matching blocksize growth to technological
progress not limiting centralization pressure.  They are somewhat related,
but I want to be clear on what I originally stated.  I would also point out
that Peter's proposal lacks this technical criteria as well.

That being said, I think designing any growth rates on theoretical
centralization pressure is not sensible and Peter's proposal rightly
excludes it and attempts instead for a very gradual increase over time
attempting to match blocksize growth that is consistent with technological
bandwidth growth.  The problem is that it ignores the last 6 years (we are
already "behind") and underestimates bandwidth and storage growth. (See
Nielsen's law which states 50% and has held for 30 years).

Peter seems to be of the belief that since bitcoin will never be able to
handle all the world's transactions we should instead "...decrease the need
for trust required in off-chain systems...".  This is akin to basing all
the world's transactions on a small settlement layer, much like balancing a
pyramid upside down it will topple.

I'm of the belief that the "reasonable node" test is a simple enough test
to maintain decentralization.

A raspberry pie 2 node on reasonable Internet connection with a reasonable
hard drive can run a node with 8 or 20mb blocks easily.

As Peter's proposal indicates, "If over time, this growth factor is beyond
what the actual technology offers, the intention should be to soft fork a
tighter limit."  I wholeheartedly agree, which is why we should plan to be
ahead of the curve...not behind it.

I'm curious as I've not seen any data on this subject. How fast can a RP2 do the necessary cryptographic calculations to validate blocks of various sizes?

While everyone tends to talk in terms of 10 minutes per block that is, of course, only a typical time and doesn't account for situations in which 2 or more blocks are found in quick succession (which, of course, happens on a daily basis). At what point does, say, an RP2 node fail to be able to validate a second or third block because it's still not finished processing the first?

If someone were to be playing games with the system and mining transactions without first broadcasting them to the network then how long would that take? This would in essence define the ability to DoS lower-performance nodes (ignoring all of the other usual considerations such as bandwidth, etc).

Message-ID: <CAKzdR-o7_A2N=-=3muXcs7ptnoO2d3wSBAMAziNGs7XjnceGBQ@mail.gmail.com>

What would you do?

a. Double the block size
b. Reduce the block rate to a half (average 5 minute blocks)

Suppose this is a one time hard fork. There no drastic technical problems
with any of them: "SPV" mining and the relay network has shown that block
propagation is not an issue for such as small change. Mining centralization
won't radically change for a 2x adjustment.

So what would be best for Bitcoin?

I suspect some (if not most of you) would choose b. Because reducing the
block interval saves us real time. Waiting 30 minutes for a 3-block
confirmation is... such a long time! Time that we value. Time that
sometimes we waste waiting. Time that makes a difference for us. Doubling
the block size does not change the user perception of Bitcoin in any way.

Then why most discussions go around doubling the block size?

Each change require less than 20 lines of code (*) in the reference code,
and minimum change in other wallets.

Currently there is no idle mining hardware for hire, so the security of six
10-minute block confirmation is equivalent to the security of six 5-minute
block confirmations, as described in Satoshi's paper (if there were 51%
spare mining hardware for hire, then obviously hiring that hardware for 30
minutes would cost less than hiring it for 1 hour).

Why we discuss a 2x block size increase and not a 1/2 block interval
reduction? Aren't we Bitcoin users after all?

Best regards,
 Sergio.

(*) b requires increasing the transaction version number, to support the
old nLockTime rate.

Because halving the block interval comes with costs to SPV proofs (which
double the number of headers) and mining centralization (doubles the
selfish mining effect of latency) for the questionable benefit of a block
expectation time that is still measured in minutes, not seconds.

Doubling the block size is safer than halving the block interval, for the
same effect in aggregate transactions per second.

I can think of a variety of protocols that broadcast information and don't
really care about whether it gets delivered.. Think of everything that uses
UDP on TCP/IP. The most basic thing I can think of would be low-priority
notifications that are sent to the entire Bitcoin universe, but don't need
to persist. The protocol provides for a signed and thus verified message,
and a method for broadcasting it to every node that might be interested in
seeing it. If it never makes it into a block, so be it. If it does, so be
it.

I see a pretty big problem if this really is your insight, the need an 
individual has for running a node is a completely different concept than the 
need for nodes to exist.  And, really, you are describing miners, not nodes.

good thing is that you seem to agree with me as your continue with;

Thats the 'need' I was talking about.
As we concluded in our previous email, the need to run a node is inversely 
proportional to the ability (or willingness) to trust others.
And lets face it, practically everyone trusts others with their money today.

That won't really have any influence, economics 101 says that it doesn't work 
that way.  Lowering the cost on a product won't make it sell more without the 
people wanting or needing the product.

That is your opinion. At least, I don't see that conclusion supported by 
evidence.
I'll defer to Gavins emails that countered this point better.

Mark,
It took you 3 minutes to respond to my e-mail. And I responded to you 4
minutes later. If you had responded to me in 10 minutes, I would be of out
the office and we wouldn't have this dialogue. So 5 minutes is a lot of
time.

Obviously this is not a technical response to the technical issues you
argue. But "minutes" is a time scale we humans use to measure time very
often.

:)

Pieter, you either misunderstood or misquoted Gavin here.
The tradeoffs Gavin talks about are about trusting your own node or using a 
centralized system (as the two extremes in a spectrum).

Your answer talks about something completely different. Not sure how your 
answer fits in this conversation, although, you do seem to use these 
misunderstandings often to push your own position in a way that to the naive 
reader it sounds like others agree with you.  Please try to be more concise 
and on-topic.

You want to change the basic economics of Bitcoin itself.
If anything is "unnecessary risks", that would be a clear contender.

How many clients actually evict transactions from their mempool currently? If 
the backlog grows infinitely (as a result of more in than out), that would be 
a problem.
How many wallets re-transmit their transaction when your local full nodes 
mempool no longer has it? Problem.

What will the backlash be when people here that are pushing for "off-chain-
transactions" fail to produce a properly working alternative, which 
essentially means we have to say NO to more users. We can't service you, 
sorry. Please go away.

At this time and this size of bitcoin community, my personal experience (and 
I've been part of many communities) saying NO to new customers will kill the 
product totally. Or, if we are lucky, just make an altcoin that quickly 
becomes the de-facto standard.

But what's more likely to matter is seconds. What you need then is some
variant of multisignature notaries (Greenaddress.it, lightning network),
where the combination of economic incentives and legal liability gives you
the assurance of doublespend protection from the time of publication of the
transaction to the first block confirmation.

It's not as simple as trusting miners, Bitcoin security needs some
reasonable portion of economic interest to be validating their receipt
of coins against a full node they run.

I do it myself because I dont want to lose money, as do many power
users.  Most bitcoin ecosystem companies do it.  You dont have to run
it all the time, just sync it when you want to check your own coin
receipt with higher assurance.

Even if you are willing to trust others, trusting miners or random
full nodes would be unsafe if not for the reasonable portion of
economic interest validating their own received coins.  That holds
miners honest, otherwise they could more easily present fake
information to SPV users.

> And lets face it, practically everyone trusts others with their money today.

Bitcoin's very reason for existence is to avoid that need.  For people
fully happy to trust others with their money, Bitcoin may not be as
interesting to them.

Actually I gave a cached answer earlier which on further review may need
updating. (Bad Mark!)

I presume by "what's more likely to matter is seconds" you are referencing
point of sale. As you mention yourself, lightning network or green address
style payment escrow obviates the need for short inter-block times.

But with lightning there is a danger of channels being exhausted in the
time between blocks, causing the need for new channels to be established.
So lightning does in fact benefit from moderately shorter inter-block
times, although how much of an issue this will be is anyone's guess now.

Still the first two points about larger SPV proofs and selfish mining still
hold true, which sets the bar particularly high for justifying more
frequent blocks.

I wasnt clear but it seemed in your previous mail that you seemed to
say you dont mind trusting other people with your money, and so
presumably you are OK using these services, and so have no problem?

> At this time and this size of bitcoin community, my personal experience (and

Who said no to anything?  The systems of off-chain transfer already
exist and are by comparison to Bitcoins protocol simple and rapid to
adapt and scale.

Indications are that we can even do off-chain at scale with Bitcoin
similar trust-minimisation with lightning, and duplex payment
channels; and people are working on that right now.

I think it would be interesting and useful for someone, with an
interest in low trust, high scale transactions, to work on and propose
an interoperability standard and API for such off-chain services to be
accessed by wallets, and perhaps periodic on-chain inter-service
netting.

In some rare occasions in everyday life, what matters is seconds. Like when
paying for parking in the car while some other cars are behind you in the
line. You don't want them to get upset.

I takes me tens of minutes to shop. But once you choose your merchandise
and your payment starts processing, if the payment system allows several
payments to be pending simultaneously and you're not blocking the next
person to pay, then I don't care waiting some minutes for confirmation. But
saving 10 minutes of confirmation is a lot.

I ague that our time is mostly measured in minutes (but I don't have any
sociological, cultural, genetic or anthropological evidence). It takes
minutes to read an e-mail, minutes to correct a bug, minutes to have lunch,
minutes to drive to the office, minutes to talk to your kids. A payment
taking 1 minute is much better than a payment taking 10. If I could choose
a single thing to change to Bitcoin, I would lower the payment time, even
within the minute scale.

Then I would suggest working on payment channel networks. No decrease of
the interblock time will ever compete with the approximately instant time
it takes to validate a microchannel payment.

I'm making this a thread of its own because this is very serious.

The idea that Bitcoins very reason for existence is to avoid trusting anyone 
but yourself is something I've heard before, and I have to comment because it 
is a destructive thought. It is very much untrue because we don't live in a 
black/white world.

If you look at the history of money (500 years is enough) you may know about 
business being done in the late 1600s in Europe that included essentially a 
general ledger that every merchant used and had his own copy of (at least 
their own bits).
Merchant in France used a system that when they bought stock from one company
they didn't give them money, they instead gave them a IOU-style piece of 
paper.  To break your promise meant to be evicted from their money system.
Which to a merchant in that time is equal to starvation.

The point was NOT to trust no-one, the point was to trust everyone, but keep 
everyone honest by keeping the ledger open and publicly available.


Bitcoins current model to decentralize and distribute trust has historical 
precedent and is known to work. It was abandoned when Newton started the mint 
in London because that allowed international trade. And their system didn't 
scale.


On a tangent;
What we saw with the Internet is growth because of a lack of centralized 
controller. This does not mean lack of trust in your neighbours. Internet grew 
because permissionless innovation was allowed. Not by going from one extreme 
of central trust to the other extreme of no trust.
It flourished just by stepping out of the trust-one party extreme.

What Adam Black and probably some others must understand is that there is a 
whole spectrum between having a monopoly on trust and every player having 
their own node.

Bitcoin sole reason for existence is because it is the first every system that 
has global reach and does not need a central trusted party.
It is, in other words, the first alternative that for the very first time in 
centuries that allows innovation without permission.


> For people
> fully happy to trust others with their money, Bitcoin may not be as
> interesting to them.

So, this is to black/white. And also wrong.

This thinking will block growth towards the thing you want, and leave you 
without any toys at all.
For instance it is perfectly all right to have a central player in a poor 
country that helps millions of unbanked to use Bitcoin as their first 
international payment system.


I can only try to convince you to change your worldview be explaining some 
history and concepts you may have missed, if you don't thats fine with me. 
I do, however, have to ask you to assume people will not like Bitcoin and will 
not use it because they don't fit your worldview. That will ultimately hurt 
billions of people.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Voting by locking coins
Message-ID: <CAAO2FKEFA5ujJKe8F4-5Wnp0DCYuyHWNWhdtk5O=nCZ-zGu0rg@mail.gmail.com>

Has there ever been any discussion of locking coins till a certain date for
casting votes on an issue?

Say that the date for counting votes is 3 months from now. Every one who
wants to cast a vote must lock coins until the vote closes (using CLTV). To
increase the weight of your vote, lock more coins. Write your choice in the
scriptPubKey or an OP_RETURN data output.

On the date the vote closes the nodes tally up the coin values for the
various vote options, and the choice with the highest total is the winner.

Not saying this could be used to solve the block size issue necessarily,
but we could have choices like:
1) Keep block size the same
2) Reduce block size by 10%.
3) Increase block size by 10%.

The vote could be a rolling one. When the present vote is decided the vote
for the next 3 months starts.

Also there may need to be weighting depending on how long the coins have
been locked for, to stop voting at the last minute having an undue
influence.

If you are saying that some people are happy trusting other people,
and so would be perfectly fine with off-chain use of Bitcoin, then we
agree and I already said that off-chain use case would be a
constructive thing for someone to improve scale and interoperability
of in the post you are replying to.  However that use case is not a
strong argument for weakening Bitcoin's security to get to more scale
for that use case.

In a world where we could have scale and decentralisation, then of
course it would be nice to provide people with that outlook more
security than they seem to want.  And sometimes people dont understand
why security is useful until it goes wrong, so it would be a useful
thing to do.  (Like insurance, your money being seized by paypal out
of the blue etc).  And indeed providing security at scale maybe
possible with lightning like protocols that people are working on.

I didn't say off-chain, and gave an example of on-chain usecase with trusted middleman.

I think the context is not that "Bitcoin's reason for existence is to
avoid trusting anyone but yourself", as you state above. This kind of
dystopia is not, in my view, what the advocates of trustlessness and
security are implying.

There are those instances where we have no option other than to trust
a centralized authority. They are mostly self-appointed and do not
have the interests of the rest of us in mind. The central bank is the
obvious example - they impose their currency as "official" and then
devalue our savings and purchasing power through money supply
inflation - without our permission and in betrayal of the trust
relationship.  Bitcoin allows one to hold money and to conduct money
transactions, transmit value, and so forth without having to trust
*them* - the central bank, or anyone.

In another example, we want to conduct escrow and have to trust the
notary, because of his reputation and framed certificate, but Bitcoin
multisig makes the degree of trust between the escrow parties
irrelevant, so no apparently trustworthy "gentleman" merchant (back
then or now) can socially engineer a transaction and scam us.

I don't know if my reply and its examples is over-simplistic but it
seems you were making a moral appeal that the notion of trustlessness
was destructive - I just wanted to contextualize it to relevant use
cases. It follows, and this is what I understand from Adam's message,
that security and protection of decentralization are paramount
concerns if we want to retain the trustlessness that makes Bitcoin so
useful and powerful.

Trust takes many different forms and is not a binary function. You trust a
surgeon to do an operation and a pilot to fly a jet, but not vice versa. To
trust someone explicitly, you need to know who they are. Most social
structures work without explicit identity and they still function quite
well. For example companies are mostly anonymous to the consumer - if you
buy something in a shop you trust a chain of people producing that good. A
priori there is little reason to trust others, but rather that trust is
already developed through social institutions. Money is one such
institution with specific trust problems, and the history of money is
indeed a very good way to study these problems. Unfortunately in Bitcoin
development such insights are rare to find.

Lightning assumes explicit trust and ID - much like Ripple. That's not
going to work, and I'm surprised that someone with basic knowledge of
crypto doesn't see this problem. Having explicit counter-parties is
something very different from Bitcoin where the entity doing transactions
verification is unknowable and changes all the time. Users of Bitcoin trust
nodes doing the verification because they know it is in their best interest
to be honest. Neither Sidechains nor LT have preserve that important
property, and so IMO there are no good proposals to make Bitcoin scale (if
that is possible at all).

Interesting point of view Thomas! I agree that if we only think
towards one single direction (treat trust as a super bad thing) we
might miss some good features (or scalability levels) among the way.

Can explain why exactly do you think this? What is the problem that
you see in lightning model exactly? I am not arguing, maybe you are
right and there is a part of the lightning network proposal which I
missed, so that is why I am asking for clarification here.

Lightning doesn't require explicit trust, worst case scenario you can
end up with coins blocked until next in-chain broadcast. It depends on
each and very hub, obviously there will also be trusted, identified
public hubs but we can also have anonymous hubs.

That's basically the definition of off-chain.  When we say MtGox or
coinbase etc are off-chain transactions, that is because a middle man
has the private keys to the coins and gave you an IOU of some kind.

> Trust takes many different forms and is not a binary function.

Many Bitcoiners have a rather unusual notion of trust.  While many state 
the established financial systems cannot be trusted they imply that many 
within the Bitcoin world need to be trusted.   There are some very 
irresponsible and unusual people who have authority to do things in the 
Bitcoin world such as manage the Wiki, the Github repository, and are 
given an emergency alert key.  Some of these people are only known by 
some sort of screen name.  If anyone questions any of these processes 
they are chastised and labeled a "troll".  For instance, anyone who 
questioned Mt. Gox back in 2013 was labeled a "buttcoiner" or something 
similar.  So I would say many people, including many on this list, don't 
fully understand the claims they are making about the "truslessness" of 
Bitcoin.

 >Lightning doesn't require explicit trust,

There seems to be semantic issues with describing trust and the 
lightning network.  You need to trust the other party during the 
transactions in the channel for it to work.  Yes there is way to cash 
out if the other party does not cooperate but that is not the same thing 
as saying it is trustless.  Many people are confused about this part of 
decentralization where the network has to take time to reach consensus. 
  Some people think that you can use some kind of technological trick to 
avoid this lag time and still have a completely trustless system.  It is 
a tradeoff.

>>  What is the problem that

How do you know who is who online? If Alice and Bob want to transact and
haven't exchanged keys before they need public-key infrastructure
out-of-band to identify themselves. Which means they are using SSL and
Certificate authorities and trust them. If you have non-cooperative hubs
they could flood the network and make it unusable. And why should hubs
cooperate? There are no incentives in the system.

I'm so sorry to have to correct you again, and please don't feel bad about 
misreading my post twice.

Sending something to another Bitcoin on-chain user is really on-chain. Please 
believe me when I say that I actually understand my own example.

Yes, John Dillon proposed a very clever and viable blocksize vote scheme on this list awhile back: https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net/msg02323.html

Thanks for this Peter. It is quite long winded and complicated so I just
wanted to clarify one particular point. In John's proposal, are the coins
actually locked up, or are they still freely spendable post-vote? Otherwise
there is no real cost to casting votes. Locking coins up is related to the
time-value of money and has a cost the longer they are locked up for.

John Dillon's proposal is essentially to have the economic majority give miners *permission* to raise the blocksize; making the vote costly is against the design intent of accurately capturing the broadest possible economic consensus.

I think that if a vote was free, no matter how much weight it carried, then
it could be easily bought and the vote manipulated. If the cost of the vote
was proportional to its weight, then it would be harder to manipulate the
vote.
I know I haven't explained that thoroughly, but as an analogy think to how
markets determine the clearing price for a good. Votes in markets cost
money.

Bitcoin is an irreversible payment system.  When you pay someone using its
main selling point, which is removing the need for physical presence, you
are trusting that person.  Bitcoin doesn't obviate trust.  It obviates
authority.  Centralization of trust is what creates the authority that we
all recognize as bad for our species.  It does this by making the
authority's use of coercion acceptable.

Bitcoin removes the need for authority, not trust.  It replaces trust in a
single body with trust in a majority.  We want that majority to be healthy
and varied (as opposed to largely co-opted by some authority). The
replacement has two effects.  1) It is very difficult for any single body
to become the (coercive) authority that everyone has to trust (like central
banks). 2) It is very easy for a person to find a different single body to
trust if they don't like the one they are trusting now - or even stop
trusting one body and trust the majority instead, relying on #1 for
protection, and taking on the responsibility of running a full node.

The philosophical foundation of a thing is ultimately the basis of its
value, so I thought it useful to point out the distinction between
authority and trust in the bitcoin ecosystem.  I welcome disagreements with
my philosophical position, as that is how I learn.

Dave.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] The use of tx version field in BIP62 and 68
Message-ID: <bcebe52e7f66f2065d48e089d773156b@xbt.hk>

BIP68 rules and some of the BIP62 rules are applied only if the tx 
version is >=2 and >=3 respectively. Therefore, it is not possible to 
create a tx which follows BIP62 but not BIP68. If we introduce v4 tx 
later, BIP62 and BIP68 will all become mandatory.

Some rules, e.g. "scriptPubKey evaluation will be required to result in 
a single non-zero value" in BIP62, will cause trouble when we try to 
introduce a new script system with softfork.

I suggest to divide the tx version field into 2 parts: the higher 4 bits 
and lower 28 bits.

BIP62 is active for a tx if its highest bits are 0000, and the second 
lowest bit is 1.

BIP68 is active for a tx if its highest bits are 0000, and the third 
lowest bit is 1.

So it will be easier for us to re-purpose the nSequence, or to take 
advantage of malleability in the future. If this is adopted, the 
nSequence high bit requirement in BIP68 becomes unnecessary as we could 
easily switch it off.

The low bits will allow 28 independent BIPs and should be ample for many 
years. When they are exhausted, we can switch the high bits to a 
different number (1-15) and redefine the meaning of low bits. By that 
time, some of the 28 BIPs might have become obsoleted or could be 
merged.

(I'm not sure if there are other draft BIPs with similar interpretation 
of tx version but the comments above should also apply to them)

It is not a bug that you are unable to selectively choose these features
with higher version numbers. The version selection is in there at all
because there is a possibility that there exists already signed
transactions which would violate these new rules. We wouldn't want these
transactions to become unspendable. However moving forward there is no
reason to selectively pick and choose which of these new consensus rules
you want to apply your transaction.

I think I have explained my motivation but let me try to make it 
clearer.

For example, BIP62 says "scriptPubKey evaluation will be required to 
result in a single non-zero value". If we had BIP62 before BIP16, P2SH 
could not be done in the current form because BIP16 leaves more than one 
element on the stake for non-upgrading nodes. BIP17 also violates BIP62.

BIP68 is "only enforced if the most significant bit of the sequence 
number field is set.", so it is optional, anyway. All I do is to move 
the flag from sequence number to version number.

The blocksize debate shows how a permanent softfork may cause trouble 
later. We need to be very careful when doing further softforks, making 
sure we will have enough flexibility for further development.

I see value in lowering the block size or leaving it where it is. We expect
to run out of space, and I think it's a good idea to prepare for that,
rather than avoid it.  When we run out of space and the block size is low,
we will see problems.  If we raise the block size, we will NOT see these
problems until bitcoin is bigger and more important and the pressure is
higher.

Someone mentioned that when the backlog grows faster than it shrinks, that
is a real problem.  I don't think it is.  It is a problem for those who
don't wait for even one confirmation, but backlogs in the past have already
started training users to wait for at least one confirmation, or go
off-chain.  I am comfortable leaving those zero-conf people in a little bit
of trouble.  Everyone else can double-spend (perhaps that's not as easy as
it should be in bitcoin core) and use a higher fee, thus competing for
block space.  Yes, $5 transactions suck, but $0.15 is not so bad and about
twice the average right now.

Meanwhile, the higher fees everyone starts feeling like paying, along with
the visibility of the problems caused by full-blocks, will provide
excellent justification and motivation for increasing the limit.  My
favorite thing to do is to have a solution ready for a problem I expect to
see, see the problem (so I can measure things about it) and then implement
the solution.

In my experience, the single biggest reason not to run a full node has to
do with starting from scratch: "I used to run a full node, but last time I
had to download the full blockchain, it took ___ days, so I just use (some
wallet) now."  I think that has been improved with headers-first, but many
people don't know it.

I have some ideas how a "full node" could postpone being "full" but still
be nearly completely operational so that the delay between startup and
having a full blockchain is nearly painless.  It involves bonded
representation of important not-so-large pieces of data (blocks that have
my transactions, the complete UTXO as of some height, etc.).  If I know
that I have some btc, I could offer it (say, 100 or 1000 transaction fees'
worth) to anyone who will guarantee good data to me, and then when I have
the whole blockchain, I will know if they were honest.  If done right, the
whole network could know whether or not they were honest and enforce the
bond if they weren't.  Credit the Lightening paper for parts of this idea.

I agree
There are a lot of difficult technical problems introduced by insufficient block space that are best addressed now.  As well as problems that scale will exacerbate like bootstrapping that we should develop solutions for first.

You people are the most selfish kind of people in the world. Blackmail
developers with overload of the system, to try to force them to urgently
come up with solutions to the problem. The solution is always going to
be... wait for it... "increase the block size". There is not enough time or
manpower to do anything else. We are witnessing a tragedy of the commons
before our very eyes.

I agree problems for space restrictions should be solved, and the sooner the 
better.
What your statement has as a side-effect is that we will run into problems when 
the moment of insufficient block space comes *this* year instead of in 5 years.

I can practically guarantee that no proper solutions will be deployed in time 
for natural growth of usage to reach always 1Mb full blocks.
Having several more years to make such solutions will be very healthy.

Notice that many people here have tried but have been unable to find a relation 
between max-blocksize and full node-count.

Also, there are pretty good solutions already, like a bootstrap torrent and 
the headers first. In the upcoming release the actual CPU load should also get 
better making the actual download much much faster than the 0.9 release.

Or, in other words, these problems have been solved in a large part already, 
and more is underway.
I don't expect them to be showstoppers when a the network finally allows bigger 
than 1Mb blocks. Natural growth has shown that blocks won't jump in size 
significantly in one month anyway. So this scenario still has 6 months or so.

The mention you refer to was about the fact that the software doesn't cope 
well with a continuously growing mempool.
If Bitcoind starts eating more and more memory, I expect lots of people that 
run it now to turn it off.

I am wondering how you concluded that? The only time we saw full blocks for a 
considerable amount of time was when we had a spammer, and the only thing
we taught people was to use higher fees.
Actually, we didn't teach people anything, we told wallet developers to do it. 
Most actual users were completely ignorant of the problem.

Full blocks will then stop being a supported usecase when real humans are 
trying to buy a beer or a coffee. Waiting for a confirmation won't work either 
for the vast majority of the current usages of Bitcoin in the real world.

This is false, if you want to double spent you have to do a lot of work and 
have non-standard software.  For instance sending your newer transaction to a 
random node will almost always get it rejected because its a double spent. 
Replace by fee (even safe) is not supported in the vast majority of Bitcoin 
land.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Alternative chain support for payment protocol
Message-ID: <55C75FC8.6070807@jrn.me.uk>

BIP 70 currently lists two networks, main and test (inferred as 
testnet3) for payment protocol requests. This means that different 
testnets cannot be supported trivially, and the protocol cannot be used 
for alternative coins (or, lacks context to indicate which coin the 
request applies to, which is particularly dangerous in cases where coins 
share address prefixes).

I propose adding a new optional "genesis" field as a 16 byte sequence 
containing the SHA-256 hash of the genesis block of the network the 
request belongs to, uniquely identifying chains without any requirement 
for a central registry. For backwards compatibility, the "network" field 
would contain "main" for Bitcoin main net, "test" for Bitcoin testnet3, 
and "other" for other networks apart from those two.

I'd appreciate initial feedback on the idea, and if there's no major 
objections I'll raise this as a BIP.

The reason BIP 70 doesn't do this is the assumption that alt coins are ...
well .... alt. They can vary in arbitrary ways from Bitcoin, and so things
in BIP70 that work for Bitcoin may or may not work for other coins.

If your alt coin is close enough to BIP 70 that you can reuse it "as is"
then IMO we should just define a new network string for your alt. network =
"dogecoin-main" or whatever.

You could also use the genesis hash as the network name. That works too.
But it's less clear and would involve lookups to figure out what the
request is for, if you find such a request in the wild. I don't care much
either way.

A sha256 hash is 32 bytes, but otherwise I agree with this proposal.
Genesis block hash is the logical way to identify chains, moving forward.

I'm cautious of using human-meaningful identifiers, especially any that 
might require a central repository, due to name collisions. Examples 
that could be complicated include BitcoinDark, Litedoge, and other names 
that base on existing coins. I think the ability to differentiate 
between test networks is also useful.

Could certainly just use the genesis hash as network ID, that would 
work. Bit long, but suspect 64 bytes isn't the end of the world! I'll 
see if any more responses come in then raise a BIP for using genesis 
hash as an alternative to short names.

Consider how Bob will receive money using the Lightning Network.

Bob receives a payment by applying a contract to his local payment
channel, increasing the amount payable to him when the channel is closed.

There are two possible sources of funding for Bob's increased claim. 
They can appear alone, or in combination:


Funding Source (1)
A deposit from Bob's payment hub

Bob can receive funds, if his payment hub has made a deposit to the
channel.  Another name for this is "credit".

This credit has no default risk: Bob cannot just take payment hub's
deposit. But neither can Bob receive money, unless payment hub has
advanced it to the channel (or (2) below applies).  Nothing requires the
payment hub to do this.

This is a 3rd-party dependency totally absent with plain old bitcoin.   
It will come with a fee and, in an important way, it is worse than the
current banking system.  If a bank will not even open an account for Bob
today, why would a payment hub lock up hard bitcoin to allow Bob to be
paid through a Poon-Dryja channel?


Funding Source (2)
Bob's previous spends

If Bob has previously spent from the channel, decreasing his claim on
its funds (which he could have deposited himself), that claim can be
re-increased.

To avoid needing credit (1), Bob has an incentive to consolidate
spending and income in the same payment channel, just as with today's
banks.  This is at odds with the idea that Bob will have accounts with
many payment hubs.  It is an incentive for centralization.


With Lightning Network, Bob will need a powerful middleman to send and
receive money effectively.  *That* is uninteresting to me.

Tom, you appear to be misunderstanding how lightning network and
micropayment hub-and-spoke models in general work.

> But neither can Bob receive money, unless payment hub has

On the contrary the funds were advanced by the hub on the creation of the
channel. There is no credit involved. if the funds aren't already available
for Bob to immediately claim his balance, the payment doesn't go through in
the first place.

Another possibility to support side|alt-chains is the bip44 coin type
registry.

A problem that hasn't been mentioned is that a coin can extend the protocol
in an incompatible way (different protocol buffer format) so just changing
the network field in the PaymentDetails message will not work. A better
approach is to add an optional coin type field to the PaymentRequest and
serialize the incompatible PaymentDetails to the serialized_payment_details
field.

To support a future testnet4 in PaymentDetails we only need to add a new
network string like "test4".

In the Lightning network it is assumed that the balances can always be
settled on the blockchain if any of the parties along the channel has a
problem. What if the fee on the settlement transactions is not high enough
to enter the blockchain? You can't do replace-by-fee after the fact. Do the
fees always have to assume worst case scenarios on the Bitcoin fee market?

That is a real problem then.  While emptying the mempool faster with bigger
blocks will help to reduce the occurrence of that problem, I propose a
user-configurable default limit to the size of the mempool as a permanent
solution regardless of block size.  "This software has stopped consuming
memory necessary to validate transactions.  You can override this by ..."
If anyone feels that protecting those running full nodes from bitcoind
eating more and more memory this way is a good idea, I can make a BIP out
of it if that would help.

I concluded that because I don't think I'm all that different than others,
and that is what I have done.  The "training" of which I speak is not
always recognized by the bitcoiner on whom it operates.  A similar
"training" is how we all learn to ignore teachers because governments force
our attendance at school.

I don't know what you meant to say is false.  I agree with the other stuff
you wrote.  Thanks for confirming that it is difficult.

I did some research on replace by fee (FSS-RBF) and on
Child-pays-for-parent (CPFP).  You point out that these solutions to paying
too-low fees are "not supported in the vast majority...".  Do you mean
philosophically or programmatically?  The trend seems to me toward
improvements, just as I insinuated may be necessary ("perhaps that's not as
easy as it should be in bitcoin core"), so, once again, I have to reiterate
that transaction backlog has valuable solutions other than increasing the
block size.

I also realized that we have already been through a period of full blocks,
so that tremendously reduces the value I see in doing it again.  It was
that "spam" test someone ran that did it for us, and I love that.  It seems
to have kicked the fee-increasability efforts in the butt, which is great.

I now place a higher priority on enabling senders to increase their fee
when necessary than on increasing the Txns per second that the network can
handle.  The competition between these two is rather unfair because of how
easy it is to apply the "N MB-blocks bandaid".

Thanks Mark.
Ok next obvious question (apologies for all of these but it seems you are
the authority on Lightning here). Is the Lightning system limited in the
number of hops there can be in the payment channel? I am looking at the
initial Lightning slides presented in February and it looks like the
locktime decrements by 1-day along each hop. So the more hops there are the
longer my bitcoins are potentially locked up for?

That's a chuckle.

As I said, nothing requires the hub to advance anything, and if it does,
Bob can expect to pay for it.

We'll see whether hubs assess a fee for depositing funds, whether the fee
depends on the amount deposited, and whether it depends on the amount of
time it stays there.

I predict "all of the above." There is a name for these kinds of fees.  Can
you guess it?

I'm glad Tom is bringing these points up. There seems to be an assumption
by many that LN will be automatically awesome by virtue of it being
technically feasible with having considered whether it is economically
feasible or desirable.

So much stock has been placed in LN as the solution to the block size
debate, yet it could turn out that it sucks in practice. Then what?

Tom, my understanding is that the money that is debited from a payment hub
is simultaneously credited from either another payment hub or the person
making the payment, so that the net funds flow at a payment hub always sums
to zero. So no, there is no credit advanced by the payment hub to anyone.

Given Mark's previous answer of using CPFP and other tricks to pay for the
Bitcoin transaction fees, we can assume that Bitcoin fees do not play a
part in the payment channel balances.

So, the interesting question is what are the costs of running a payment
hub? The tx fees that a payment hub would have to pay to settle its Bitcoin
transactions would be passed on as a cost to the clients of the payment
hub. Also there is a cost to locking up funds in a payment channel (time
value of money). The lost interest or opportunity cost on those funds would
need to be paid for by its clients as well. And don't forget normal running
costs such as networking and electricity.

The costs of operating a hub are as follows:

Time value of the funds the Hub has locked up in payment channels.
Enhanced risk of loss of control of private keys (the keys necessarily
need to be on an internet connected system).
Operating costs (I expect this will be minimal).

The hub can charge a fee for it's services to recoup these costs.

Ok good. We have established it to be a non-trivial cost.
Now, what is the growth complexity of the total cost of the network in
terms of number of connections each hub has to other hubs? And then,
consider a payment channel with many hops in it. The end-to-end users would
have to swallow all the costs of the hubs in the channel.

I suspect there is some amount of confusion here on terms.

The hub is essentially swapping funds between payment channels.

The hub's entire business is centered around having payment channels
open with other hubs/users.

If the hub requires user funds to open these channels... then the users
have no reason to pay the hub anything in fees.

A hub that doesn't use it's own funds to open payment channels to other
hubs/merchants is useless.

Right, you've stated a bunch of facts, but how does it answer my concerns
of the exploding cost of the network the more interconnected it it?

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Off-chain transactions and miner fees
Message-ID: <55C7D234.1040306@bitmarkets.net>

Hello all,

one argument I often read on this mailing list is that it's essential to
reward miners with transaction fees at some point to secure the network.

Off-chain transactions, whether it's Lightning or something else,
potentially extract fees, which may otherwise be paid to miners, if the
transactions were actually on-chain.

In this context, wouldn't it be contradictory, maybe even harmful, to
aim for an environment, where some/many/most transactions are off-chain?

I have not yet seen this conflict addressed in the recent discussions.

On the contrary those costs are clearly very low.

Both the time value of money and operating expenses will be trivial with
even a small volume of transactions.

The true cost of operating a hub is clearly in the enhanced risk of loss.

It's clear that risk of loss will be moderated by market forces.

The hubs which are better at securing their systems will reduce their
risk of loss and obtain a competitive advantage.

It's also important to note that the risk of loss is the same whether
the hub is doing 1 transaction/second or 1 million transactions/second.

At 1 transaction/second the cost (but not necessarily the fees) is going
to be quite high.

At 1 million transactions/second the cost is going to be very very low.

While we're on the subject of payment hubs / lightning network...

I'd love to see somebody write up a higher-level description of what the
user experience is like, what communication happens underneath, and what
new pieces of infrastructure need to get built to make it all work.

A use-case to start with:

A customer starts with eleven on-chain bitcoin. They want to pay for a nice
cup of tea. Walk me through what happens before/during/after the
transaction, assuming I have a  lightning-enabled wallet on my iPhone and
the tea shop has a lightning-enabled cash register.

Assume neither the customer nor the tea shop are technically sophisticated
-- assume the customer is using an SPV wallet and the tea shop is using a
service similar to Bitpay.

development mailing list at
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev and already
some pretty interesting explanations in the archives.

That describes the steady-state dynamics.  I refer to the hub funding
required to initiate and maintain the ability to receive payments.

If Bob opens a channel at his hub, doesn't use it for spending, and
Alice sends 1 BTC to the channel, her payment can only be applied if the
hub has funded the channel with at least 1 BTC.

Yes, the hub receives an offsetting payment (from Alice, ultimately) in
another channel.  But to make this work, it must subject 1 BTC to shared
control with Bob and forfeit the use of that money for other purposes
(opportunity cost) while the channel is open.  The opportunity cost is
likened to gold lease rates in the LN paper.  I would be surprised if
the rates charged to consumers for BTC credit aren't much closer to
today's BTC borrowing rates.  We'll see.

Burying this cost in general fees might not work very well, because
different Bobs may want different maximum payment amounts, and channels
open for different lengths of time.

The borrowing rates you're talking about involve the risk of default.

In lightning the hubs funds are not at risk so long as they maintain
control of the private keys.

The rates charged by hubs will almost certainly be orders of magnitude
below the rates charged on the various p2p lending sites....

But that seems fairly obvious... did I miss something?

I'm writing a (hopefully more accessible) summary on Lightning
currently. It might not go into too much detail with infrastructure, but
is a bit more UX focused.

It's a bit of a tangent, but I see it as necessary that all Lightning
services/wallets support on-chain payments for a multitude of reasons,
including usability and long-term security/fungibility. For that reason,
the UX flow for payment after channels are established should not be
significantly different than Payment Protocol based payment flows (with
the only exception being a possible additional fee dialog box/alert when
the fees will be higher than expected/on-chain).

The hops are limited to the time-value which the sender wishes to pay
and the minimum acceptable timeout between each hop. It should be
relatively cheap if you game it out, though (I don't forsee me opening a
1 BTC channel and being able to make $5 per month...)

1-day is used as a convenience. However, the time between hops should be
somewhat long, as the intermediate steps can be extended further when
you want to offload the HTLCs to others who have a channel open with
both counterparties. E.g. Alice sends a payment to Dave through Bob and
Carol. Bob has a channel with Carol and has an HTLC with it, but that
channel seems to be used a lot. Erin has a relationship to both Bob and
Carol, she can offload the payment so that the payment actually goes to
A->B->E->C->D. B<->C is now completely clear.

How do you send coins if you wanted to send funds below the current
IsStandard value? It should be no different. If your wallet can't send
funds below the IsStandard value on-chain today, then I don't think it
should be able to to in the future, right? If you send funds *at* the
minimum IsStandard value today, you're probably paying really high fees,
this is a problem that exists today.

I think the fee market's long-term implications for mining rewards is
very important as well! However, opening and closing channels will not
be infrequent to the point that it will never happen with Lightning.
Individuals that fill up their channel will need to accommodate
accumulation (as well as those that do a lot of disbursement). These
fund flows are not too rare, and huge payments (think the equivalent to
wire transfers today) will probably be still on-chain. I think the
payment size of micropayments to credit cards are Lightning-scale, what
people use today for wire transfers (e.g. buying a house) will be
on-chain.

What Lightning does is it mitigates the advantages that doing an end-run
around bitcoin entirely via centralized systems provides to a sufficient
level, e.g. everyone transacting on Coinbase. Having everything on
centralized services will have significantly lower on-chain transactions
than Lightning and is one of the more viable alternative off-chain
payments.

Fundamentally, without off-chain transactions, there's a paradox within
a viable fee market. If you presume that fees should be relatively
competitive (i.e. not asymptotically close to zero), that implies that
higher-value transactions *will* be prioritized over low-value
transactions, as high-value transactions are willing to pay higher fees.
Wire transfers are cheap when it's a million-dollar wire.

In my view, different transaction values is the much larger risk for
on-chain transaction fee markets, with high-value transactions crowding
out low-value transactions on-chain. With lightning, it significantly
mitigates this problem by aggregating the low-value transactions
off-chain.

Nodes in the Lightning network earn fees that wouldn't be there if it weren't for the Lightning network. The base Bitcoin layer can't handle the transaction throughout that Lightning can, so the Lightning fees were never available to Bitcoin miners in the first place.

What Lightning does is raise the value of a transaction on the block chain. Imagine you're a Lightning node, and in order to collect your fees, that you've earned over the past month, you have to settle on the blockchain. If you've earned, say, 0.5 BTC in fees, you can attach a huge 0.005 BTC fee to the Bitcoin settlement transaction. The miners earn a larger fee, and you make sure your transaction gets into the blockchain quickly, and you can afford to pay this fee because you've made much more on the Lightning transactions you've routed.

While that is interesting, and I'll surely check it out, I think this list 
should get a good idea of what the limitations are.

Where does it NOT make sense to use LN, where would it be better to put the 
transaction directly on the blockchain?

This is what I'd like to know.

Gavins usecase is useful, I'm also wondering about remittances and allowing 
international payments and global economy (company in Nairobi buys stock from 
company in Spain).

If a path cannot be built to the recipient through the lightning network
then a standard transaction should be used.

I don't buy that argument, you are saying a company will give away profits 
because of... what? It can?

The reason of it being faster makes no sense, as your example the channel has 
been open for a month then he really doesn't care it takes 1, 10 or 50 blocks 
before his transaction is included.  What is 5 hours wait on a month of profit?

Following this, Bitcoin and proposed payment networks like LN will be
competing for fees based on duration and cost to process transactions.

If fees on Bitcoin network stay low and zero-conf txns are possible,
competing payment networks will need some very special features to survive
and make money for their investors.

Gavin, I interpret the absence of response to these questions as a
sign that everybody agrees that  there's no other reason to increase
the consensus block size other than to avoid minimum market fees from
rising (above zero).
Feel free to correct that notion at any time by answering the
questions yourself.
In fact if any other "big block size advocate" thinks there's more
reason I would like to hear their reasons too.

Additionally, correct me if I am wrong, but the net effect from preventing
fees rising from zero would be to guarantee miners have no alternative
income from fees as block subsidy dries up and thus harm the incentives to
secure the chain.

Here's some related commits from #6382 :

And a related PR (closed for now, at least until #6235 is merged) :
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6229

I definitely add the chainID field, and support regtest in bip70 too
(code is more complex by not supporting it that it could be while
supporting it). And if we want to maintain the chain petname, I would
change "test" to "testnet3".

While "main" and "regtest" are always used for those chains, we
currently have 3 different strings for testnet3:

"testnet3": for the default data directory.
"testnet": for the GUI style, and strings showed to the user.
"test": for bip70

I really want to simplify this and I think the simplest way to do so
is by unifying everything to always use "testnet3", although that
would require modifying bip70.

Altchains aren't just altcoins and sidechains: there's also testchains
like testnet3, regtest and sizetestN ( #6382 ). Since there's so many
possible instances for sizetest, testchains are already more numerous
than altcoins (not that this last thing matters much for anything).
Just forget about altcoins and sidechains: do it for the testchains
(that's the reason why bitcoin has chainparams and multi-chain support
in the first place).

We should make things easier to add new testchains, not harder.
It is sad to see that some times things are "the wrong way" because
doing them "the right way" could "simplify things to altcoins too
much".
Such a design criterion seems so ridiculous and sad to me...

Those lookups can but just to a map in memory, like in
https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/1a4e8d8637ced45e8785ddb95b0fc20a5b8365d1#diff-64cbe1ad5465e13bc59ee8bb6f3de2e7R20

Alternatively we can maintain the chain petname field, but those are
just "standard petnames", not unique and immutable ids like the
genesis hash.

We're not modifying BIP 70, it's now immutable and can only be extended.

There's really not much point in having a dedicated chain ID for regtest
mode. You shouldn't be finding BIP70 requests for regtest outside of your
own developer machine, where the id doesn't matter.

I don't think that's necessarily true. Theoretically urgent
transactions could fund hashing power on their own while there are
still some free non-urgent transactions being mined from time to time.

Well, yes, I guess it's modifying that in the extension BIP.

The point is not having exceptions and treating all supported chains
in the same way in the code.
Having a special case for regtest makes the code more complex, not simpler.

It is frustrating to answer questions that we answered months ago,
especially when I linked to these in response to your recent "increase
advocates say that not increasing the max block size will KILL BITCOIN"
false claim:
  http://gavinandresen.ninja/why-increasing-the-max-block-size-is-urgent
  https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32

Executive summary: when networks get over-saturated, they become
unreliable.  Unreliable is bad.

Unreliable and expensive is extra bad, and that's where we're headed
without an increase to the max block size.

RE: the recent thread about "better deal with that type of thing now rather
than later" :  exactly the same argument can be made about changes needed
to support a larger block size-- "better to do that now than to do that
later."  I don't think either of those arguments are very convincing.

Gavin,
They are not analogous.

Increasing performance and making other changes that will help allow
scaling can be done while at small scale or large scale.
Dealing with full blocks and the resultant feedback effects is something
that can only be done when blocks are full.  It's just too complicated a
problem to solve without seeing the effects first hand, and unlike the
block size/scaling concerns, its binary, you're either in the situation
where demands outgrows supply or you aren't.

Fee estimation is one example, I tried very hard to make fee estimation
work well when blocks started filling up but it was impossible to truly
test and in the small sample of full blocks we've gotten since the code
went live, many improvements made themselves obvious.  Expanding mempools
is another issue that doesn't exist at all if supply > demand.   Turns out
to also be a difficult problem to solve.

Nevertheless, I mostly agree that these arguments shouldn't be the reason
not to expand block size, I think they are more just an example of how
immature all of this technology is, and we should be concentrating on
improving it before we're trying to scale it to world acceptance levels.
The saddest thing about this whole debate is how fundamental improvements
to the science of cryptocurrencies (things like segregated witness and
confidential transactions) are just getting lost in the circus debate
around trying to cram a few more users into the existing system sooner
rather than later.

I think I see your point of view. You see demand for on-chain transactions
as a single number that grows with adoption. Once the transaction creation
rate grows close to the capacity, transactions will become unreliable, and
you consider this a bad thing.

And if you see Bitcoin as a payment system where guaranteed time to
confirmation is a feature, I fully agree. But I think that is an
unrealistic dream. It only seems reliable because of lack of use. It costs
1.5 BTC per day to create enough transactions to fill the block chain at
the minimum relay fee, and a small multiple of that at actual fee levels.
Assuming that rate remains similar with an increased block size, that
remains cheap.

If you want transactions to be cheap, it will also be cheap to make them
unreliable.

I'm not trying to be obstinate but I seriously can't see how they are
different.
When you say unreliable I think you mean "unreliable for cheap fee
transactions". Transactions with the highest fees will always confirm
reliably. For example, a 1 btc fee tx will probably always confirm very
reliably even if capacity never increases and demands increases a lot.

This is questionable to some degree:

While it's given that limited space inherently limits the number of
on-chain transactions, one could argue that the limited space could
result in significantly higher fees due to the competition.

Likewise, if we assume there were a higher/no limit, then it would also,
or especially, be favorable to pay miners, instead of
off-chain-serivce-provider X.

In both scenarios, with, or without capacity limit, it doesn't seem
favorable to move transactions off-chain.

Imagine you're a Lightning node, and in order to collect your fees, that you've earned over the past month, you have to settle on the blockchain. If you've earned, say, 0.5 BTC in fees, you can attach a huge 0.005 BTC fee to the Bitcoin settlement transaction. The miners earn a larger fee, and you make sure your transaction gets into the blockchain quickly, and you can afford to pay this fee because you've made much more on the Lightning transactions you've routed.

I thought this would be a helpful visualization in the discussion:

http://mapofcoins.com/

Of note are the differences between alts which were derived from BTC
(Proof-of-work algorithm: SHA-256), vs. those which were developed in
a different fashion such as BCN (Proof-of-work algorithm: CryptoNight)
and its alts.

I guess the assumption here is a full-block scenario where users of LN would be
willing to pay 100 times the fees users of crude transactions would be willing
to pay for the same limited space in the blockchain, simply because LN would
group 100 real world payments into 1 crude transaction.

Hello,

If I understand this correctly, Lightning only requires transaction
malleability to be fixed to be able to work ~ I believe that was going
to happen in a release of (bitcoind), but I'm not sure if that is
correct on timing ( note also, this wiki seems to be out of date on
infos about bitcoind https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoind )

I have also heard it said that bitcoin should support relative
locktime opcodes so that long-lived micropayment channels would be
able to be created, such that there would be Lightning functionality
beyond the basic microhop channels (which would be short-lived in
nature at the basic level).

This would be nice, but it seems like such discussions would take a
while to get done as basic development issues right now aren't even
wrapping up (e.g. blocksize debate related stuff.)  Note that I've
been in favor of going ahead with Cameron Garnham's dynamic softfork
proposal right now, which can be seen at http://is.gd/DiFuRr - testing
it out, seeing how that works, and at the same time making
preparations for moving forward with Garzik's BIP 100 (which could be
tailored or refined based on additional data gathered, without being
turned into a controversial fork (e.g. needs to make sure to avoid
inclusion of XT, for example).  Garnham's proposal and Garzik's
proposal are not mutually exclusive, imho, and I don't see why the
matter can't simply be resolved, it seems to be just an endless pile
of argumentation that will go on forever and ever.  This needs to,
like, stop.

Also, it strikes me that unless and until certain changes can be made
in bitcoin that would reduce fees and cost to transact, solutions such
as Lightning are going to fill the gap whether or not you want them
to; users have a choice in the market, and as the billions of unbanked
are gradually excluded from straight bitcoin, people will seek other
services which offer them lesser fees to transact, or they will seek
other coins which offer them lesser cost to transact.  It is, after
all, an open market.  I have made this point before elsewhere albeit
with more emphasis (and data to back up my point):
( On Github at Pull Request #6201: http://is.gd/8bW0zq )

In making and successfully defending such points on Github, the
following conclusions were drawn:
As the cost to transact goes higher and higher based on this
observable trend (due to all the factors mentioned in the thread on
github), then people who are affected by these rising costs to
transact will do one of three things with respect to bitcoin (and
virtual currencies generally):
1) Ignore bitcoin (an unlikely possibility, but it is one that would
occur),
2) adopt alts which are more inclined to allow people to perform
microtransactions,
3) and/or use bitcoin increasingly off-chain, which is likely to come
with its own set of problems for the network.

Regarding donation or microdonation use cases, To keep it all
on-chain, wallets can be designed to accumulate donation micro-amounts
according to donation settings of a user (in voluntary donation use
cases such as in ABIS -- http://abis.io ) as an internal accounting
feature, for example, and when enough donation value is accumulated,
it can be sent to the recipient by piggybacking on one of the user's
daily transactions.  This is one method doing so in a manner which is
on-chain; depending on the cryptocurrency under consideration, the
feasibility of doing this in a wallet will be greater or lesser.

No offence, but I think that anyone who claims a block size limit change
can be done as a soft fork has some basic reading to do first.

Also, please keep this thread about Lightning.

Technically, my proposal has been thus:

"Note that I've
been in favor of going ahead with Cameron Garnham's dynamic softfork
proposal right now, which can be seen at http://is.gd/DiFuRr - testing
it out, seeing how that works, and at the same time making

Regtest isn't really a network at all, just a testing mode of Bitcoin Core...

Sorry, I meant to stress that BIPs are for *Bitcoin* improvements 
specifically. Things which only improve altcoins, while a perfectly fine thing 
to standardise, are outside the scope of what belongs in a BIP.

Perhaps, however, this could be made to kill 2 birds with one stone, by 
ensuring it addresses the need for payments made of bitcoins on a sidechain?
For this, a merchant who wants a sidechain payment would presumably be able to 
provide a script from the main chain already, but an extension allowing 
payment directly on the sidechain (at the customer's choice) avoids the need 
to round-trip it...

That's not a universally held belief. See for example:

 https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Funding_network_security#Alternatives
 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=157141.0

It's also not clear to me what amount of security people actually "want".
In late May, Mike Hearn wrote:

 "Currently the Bitcoin community is being effectively taxed about
  $832,000 per day ... just to support mining! [...]

  We?re not spending so much on mining because we really need it. It?s
  because printing money distorts behaviour."

  -- https://medium.com/@octskyward/hashing-7d04a887acc8

If $832k (25*240 btc/day * $231 USD/btc) is too much, maybe $475k/day
(reward halved, at current price) will still be too much in a year's
time? If bitcoin's price rises at just 19% pa on average (which doesn't
seem like much if you're thinking in startup/VC terms?), then the block
reward will still be worth about $475k/day after it halves again to 6.25
coins per block. So maybe the block reward pays for bitcoin transactions
and fees are effectively zero right up until the day the block reward
goes away entirely?

In any event, the lightning network offers three potential benefits over
on-chain transactions:

 - lower fees
 - shorter confirmation times
 - no ongoing costs once the channel is closed

If you have zero fees, lightning is still interesting for quick
transactions (since they offer better assurance of payment than
zero-confirmation transactions), and also for microtransactions (where
spamming the blockchain and the UTXO db with thousands of transactions
just to move $1 from here to there isn't appealing).

Every lightning transaction happens through a series of channels (at least
one, but realistically at least two; with any amount of decentralisation,
probably more likely somewhere in the range of three to twenty). Each
of those channels requires at least two blockchain transactions (one or
two to create the channel; one or three to close the channel and spend
the balances).

It's not 100% clear at this point, but keeping a lightning channel open
will probably have (hardware) costs that grow linearly in the number of
transactions [0]; in which case keeping them open forever won't be an
option, and they'll be closed when the cost of keeping it open is less
than the cost of resetting it on the blockchain (only one blockchain
transaction required). So in that case even if lightning is crazy popular,
there'll still be activity on the blockchain at whatever fee rate there
is, just by people trading off storage costs for blockchain fees.

[0] http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2015-July/000057.html

Even if it's not the case, closing a channel eventually is probably
good practice in order to rollover keys. Channels also have a maximum
theoretical number of transactions, but that's likely on the order
of exa-transactions, so is probably irrelevant. Channel profitability
likely varies over time, and since channels lock up bitcoin, closing
less profitable channels so the funds can be used elsewhere is likely
also valuable. 

With all those things together, ballpark max lifetime of a random channel
(IMHO) is somewhere in the range of two weeks to two years. If lightning
is the only thing doing transactions on the blockchain and only using
250B/txn, 8M channels with an average lifetime of 2 weeks would fill
1MB blocks; as would 210M channels with an average lifetime of a year,
or 420M channels with an average lifetime of two years. Those sort
of numbers probably roughly cover lots of Americans having access to
a lightning based point-of-sale network to buy Starbucks, eg, but not
much more than that. (You need at least one channel per customer, plus
one per business, plus something on the order of log(N) hubs to connect
them all; having multiple channels is probably about as good an idea as
having multiple credit cards).

> In this context, wouldn't it be contradictory, maybe even harmful, to
> aim for an environment, where some/many/most transactions are off-chain?

Lightning transactions will have to pay for several things:

 - the blockchain fees for opening/closing the channel
 - the time value of the funds being used to keep the channels open,
   for each channel in the route from payer to payee
 - the maintenance costs of the hardware/software to run a lightning
   channel

By contrast, blockchain transactions just have to pay miners the
blockchain fee for the transaction; there's no other intermediaries
who have to be compensated. At some point, the latter will certainly
be cheaper than the former -- since the lightning network has to pay
for third parties' time value of bitcoin there should certainly be some
"sufficiently large" amount whose time value is higher than the bitcoin
txn fee, even for a very short txn time.

It's all a bit hypothetical though -- not only is lightning still
unimplemented as yet, but I think at present the time value of bitcoin is
effectively zero (ie, afaik people recommend "just buy and hold bitcoin
and wait for the next bubble", rather than "buy bitcoin and put it in
AwesomeBank's Term Deposit product and gain 3% pa"), and most of the
time fees seem to be basically zero too.

I think the general answer is that lightning relies on the blockchain --
if the blockchain doesn't work, neither does lightning. So whatever level
of txn fees it takes to make the blockchain work; whether that's $0/txn,
1c/txn or $50/txn, nodes in the lightning network will pay that fee,
and, presumably, pass it on to the lightning network's end users in the
form of txn fees on the lightning network.

Since bitcoin is liquid you forget that one can just sell off his bitcoin
for fiat and hold that for interest. The time value is thus given by the
yield curve of interest rates.

True, but as Jorge points out, it's generally better not to have special 
cases.

It was something I was thinking about with the BIP 66 fork, that it 
could be used as a safety measure, but could also be used to find 
merchants & exchanges who are accepting coins on the wrong branch of a 
fork (and therefore are susceptible to double-spend attacks). For fork 
detection it's probably safer for the client to provide a recent block 
hash with the payment response.

I think genesis hash collisions are probably acceptable; or, the 
duplicate coins are so far rarely long-lived and it's therefore not a 
major concern at least. The server should reject any attempt to pay on 
the wrong chain, in hindsight, as it will try to relay on the network it 
expects and the transaction will be rejected.

That could definitely be done, for example by making the genesis field 
"repeated", so it specifies all potential networks. The response would 
need to indicate which hash it used, but that could be chain tip (with 
height in a further field), and provide fork detection.

Sure, that's a way to increase your net worth in real terms, but it only
works if your interest rate on your fiat account is greater than the
price rise in bitcoin over the same term. If you pull out a BTC today at
$300, put it in a bank account earning 3% interest for a year and then
buy $309 worth of bitcoin when the price has risen to $400 per BTC,
and only get 0.7725 of a bitcoin, that's not a winning proposition.
I'd call that earning a -22.75% rate (in bitcoin terms), while a 0%
rate would just be ending up with as many bitcoin after a year as you
started with. Note that in USD (and real) terms, in this scenario 77%
of a bitcoin is actually worth more after a year than 1 bitcoin is now.

You might get a positive rate of return on bitcoin invested today by
running an exchange or a gambling service of some sort; but I think
mostly, people are just sitting on their coins hoping they appreciate. If
so, (in my terminology at least) they're earning 0%, denominated in
bitcoin, and have a time-value of bitcoin of zero.

Agreed. I would just like that there was an attempt to automatically
estimate those risks before taking those risks.
Some function we're trying to optimize with simulations (based on
#6382 ) to find an ideal (according to that imperfect metric) maximum
consensus block size.
Maybe the function/simulations just take some minimum hardware
specifications and returns an block size, I don't know.

The most important thing to understand in this discussion is that it
is about a trade-off between lower fees (more maximum tx volume) and
mining (and general) centralization.
I don't know what the costs and gains curves are here (for 4MB, 1 MB
or any other number, and I don't think anybody does).
But if we can't even agree on what the advantages and disadvantages of
increasing the consensus block size maximum, it is very hard that we
can agree on a universally acceptable point or range in this trade-off
rect.

This is all probably right, but IMO we're very far away from $5/tx.
My main point about fees is that minimum mining fees rising above zero
(theri current level) is not necessarily a bad thing or an urgent
concern.
On the other hand, we have much more data about current mining
centralization, which should be very relevant information when
discussing a block size increase.

As Pieter has explained repeatedly, a big block count is not a goal in
itself, just a metric.
And if you ask me, I don't think it's all that interesting as a
metric. For all I know there could be a lot more full nodes being run
that for whatever reason are not seen by people collecting this data.
The block size maximum consensus rule limits mining centralization,
not just full node centralization. Gavin, for example, disagrees with
this.
Fortunately I believe at least 2 mathematical proofs can be produced
to demonstrate Gavin and those who think like him are wrong.

I believe that even with the relay network, and even assuming all
miners are connected using something like IBLT, a mathematical proof
can be constructed to demonstrate that bigger block sizes can prevent
the worse connected miners from being profitable.
It is important to note that the worse connected miners aren't
necessarily those with less bandwidth: maybe you have the best
bandwidth but you are poorly connected to the majority of the hashrate
(for example, because the majority of the hashrate is within the same
country but that country is not very well connected to the rest of the
world).

We're certainly far away from this being a concern in practice.
But I'm working on a mathematical proof that at some scale CPU
requirements could become a discriminating factor making the smallest
mining operations unprofitable.

I don't think there's such a thing as a "dangerous full node count level".
It's just data that can be useful to build centralization metrics.
Probably hashrate distribution by pool is much more interesting (and
if you ask me that looks really bad right now without increasing the
block size consensus maximum).

Great. I don't think that minimum mining fees will rise above 1 usd
cent/tx anytime soon even if we maintain the limit of 1MB.
Maybe that's why I'm not worried at all about "hitting the limit".
But I'm sorry, I don't have those concrete numbers because it is a
trade-off I don't think we've studied in enough detail.
Well, I can also say I wouldn't be worried at all about moving to,
say, 1.01 MB (because the difference in centralization pressure should
be minimal) and I would just take it as a "let's proof hardforks are
possible" change similar to the one proposed in bip99.

And for any size something similar could happen with some use case.
But this is a great example of a situation where I would understand
people panicking and clamoring to change the consensus rule as soon as
possible.
Even with much lower fees, say 1 usd/tx.
I think it would be a great problem to have and admittedly I'm not
worried about having it in the short term.
And if it happened overnight we could always deploy an emergency hardfork.

I think it's helping by determining who is to be served first, and
that is those who benefit more from Bitcoin (and are therefore willing
to pay higher costs for using it), in this case, people doing
international remittances.

I think the code that miners use to select which transactions to
include first needs a lot of work.
As said miners are subsidizing free transactions, increasing their own
costs for nothing in exchange.
Also, yes, there is something special about this market: it is
supposed to pay for most of the global hashrate in the not-so-far
future.
If we take too long to start moving away from total seigniorage
subsidy dependence, it may be too late when we do.

I think you are underestimating the software costs.
And you not only have to adapt the software that we have now, but also
the software that hasn't been written yet and will be written assuming
free transactions and an underdeveloped market.
Also you are over-estimating the costs: you could hit the limit but
then rise the block size maximum as soon as you reach, say 0.00001
usd/tx.
Even if minimum fees go again to zero after rising the block size
maximum, the software improvements will remain there.

And when do you think "Bitcoin will need to rely heavily on txn fees
for security"?

That's not what I've been arguing, I've just being saying that I would
be completely ok with minimum fees rising above zero (say, to 1
satoshi/tx) tomorrow.
I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing (in fact, it has some
advantages) and certainly not something we should fear to the point of
rushing hardforks to avoid it.

That's a fatal design in Feathercoin, not a mistake all altchains have
done and certainly irrelevant to Bitcoin.

Regtest is a testchain just like testnet2 and testnet3. Testchains are
the only reason why Bitcoin Core supports multiple chains using
CChainParams.

For the payment protocol testchains, sidechains and altcoins are all
quite similar.
But it is fine to just focus on testchains if sidechains and altcoins
are out of scope.

No, the chain ID needs to be unique, that's the whole point.

Nonsense. Hoping that the bitcoin price will rise is called speculation.
Hub operators won't want to do that, since prices can go down as well as
up. The money markets and government bond yield curve prices risk-free
rates of return, a guaranteed rise in value. These rates are always
positive.

Adam, I think he means a multisig escrow transaction where the escrow
is trusted by both parties, and other examples like that.
But I don't see how that is relevant, allowing trust to be involved in
different ways is a feature, but it's optional.
I think the point "you don't need to trust anyone to use Bitcoin" remains.

I don't think that is a true statement.  Users need to trust the mining 
system is working as intended.  Users also need to trust the developers 
to a certain extent.  It is about levels of trust and how much you need 
to trust these things.  When someone says something is "trustless" or 
"decentralized" they are really saying that it reaches some sort of 
"acceptable" level in their mind to "brand" it that way.

Sergio, you raise an interesting question.

I had seen your message to the list related to this idea before [1],
so I went back to research what the viewpoints and conclusions were,
if any.

I didn't find anything too conclusive, but I did find some persuasive
points by Dave Hudson [2] [3] [4] [5] that seem to also favor
increasing the target block creation rate (decreasing the target time
interval between blocks).

Considering that increasing the target block creation rate could
reduce the effect of (but not solve [6]) the fundamental mismatch
between transaction creation and the Poisson process of block
discovery [7] and could reduce miner variance (possibly an aid to
miner decentralization), I think I'd go with option B to answer your
question.

I wonder why this does not seem to ever gain more traction when you
bring it up? The idea does not seem crazy.

with any of them: "SPV" mining and the relay network has shown that block
propagation is not an issue for such as small change. Mining centralization
won't radically change for a 2x adjustment.

I don't understand this. All problems that result from propagation delay
are literally doubled by doing so. Centralization pressure results from the
ratio between propagation time and interblock time. Efficient propagation
algorithms like the relay network make this presumably grow sublinear with
larger blocks, but changing the interblock time affects it exactly
proportionally.

All problems that result from propagation delay are literally doubled by
doing this. Doubling the block size has a smaller effect. You may argue
that these centralization effects are small, but reducing the interblock
time has a stronger effect on them than the block size.

Also, you seem to consider SPV mining a good thing? It requires trust
between miners that know eachother, and fundamentally breaks the security
assumption of SPV clients... and if the propagation/interblock ratio was
lower, SPV mining would have less effect. I'd say it is exactly a result of
the centralization pressure we're trying to avoid.

IMO:

 1. User swipes their phone over merchant's NFC device
    (or scans a QR code displayed by the register or whatever)

 2. Dialog pops up on phone:
     "Pay Infinitea $5.20? [yes] [no]"

 3. User presses [yes]

 4. Brief pause

 5. "Payment confirmed" appears on both user's phone and merchant's POS
    device

The backend bits that need to happen:

 1. Merchant passes on their identity and public key, an amount, and a
    hash for the payment.

 2. User's phone goes online to see if a route to the vendor can be
    worked out, and to work out what lightning network fees are needed.
    Also translates the bitcoins requested into the user's preferred
    currency so they don't have to do maths in their head.

 3. User's phone prepares a lightning transaction to the vendor, signed
    with the corresponding lightning channel keys, using the hash the
    merchant provided, and sends it through one of the channels the user
    already has open and funded (at >$5.20 worth of bitcoins).

 4. The transaction makes its way through the lightning network, and the
    confirmation makes its way back. It's not clear to me how long this
    realistically takes (either how many hops are likely, or how long
    a single hop will actually take; I assume it should be a couple
    of seconds).

 5. UIs at both ends update. User gets a nice cup of tea.

There's a few potential problems with this:

 - what if the merchant says "no you didn't pay me, your phone is lying,
   you're a liar, I hate you, no tea for you" despite your phone saying
   you paid?

     a) you could mitigate this by having the payments be incremental
        (here's 1c, 520 times) with both terminals visibly updating;
        but that would take up to 520x longer than sending a single
        transaction, and mightn't really be any better anyway

     b) you could also have the initial negotiation involve signing
        something that could be adjudicated independently later (hey,
        here's a QR code saying he owed me a tea, here's a QR code showing
        I paid for it, and here's a video of him saying "no tea for you").

     c) Or maybe you just bite the $5 and never shop there again; just
        as you would if you handed over $5.20 in cash and then they told
        you you hadn't paid them.

 - what if the transaction's unroutable? then you get a "service
   unavailable" notice on your phone and pay by other means -- blockchain,
   cash, etc. Same as if your credit card won't register. ditto if your
   phone can't get on the internet.

 - what if the fees are large? (eg, the coffee costs $5, and the fees are
   20c?)

     a) I think they'll actually be small -- even for a 10% pa interest
        rate denominated in bitcoin, the time-value of $5.20 in bitcoin
        for 7 days is just under 1c (.35%). If so, that's noise, and the
        user legitimately doesn't care. OTOH, it does get multiplied by
        number of hops, and maybe the user cares about $5.20 vs $5.26.

     b) Alternatively, the app could just indicate the fees ("Pay $5.20 +
        <1c in fees") and/or the user could have an explicit setting for
        fee info ("Only warn me when fees are greater than either 5c/1%")

     c) Or you could have some UI magic, so the vendor's POS device
        initially says "advertised price is $5.20, but I actually
        expect just $5.05, call the rest a discount", the phone says
        "fees are 5c, so I'll display "Pay just $5.10 for a $5.20 cup of
        coffee!". That's closer to how Visa/Mastercard do it and might
        be reasonable in many cases.

 - what happens if the user presses "yes" but the lightning transaction
   then fails? you don't want to wait for the 7 day timeout to know if
   you can have a cup of tea; and you don't want the payment to go through
   after you've paid for your tea in cash, drank it, and gone home.

     a) Maybe the lightning network hubs just reply early cancelling the
        transactions, and your phone can say "failed". You can't force
        them to do this, but maybe the incentives work out okay so that
        they'll want to anyway. (I think they will) If so, everything's
        fine. As far as the merchant's concerned, you may as well have
        just pressed "No".

     b) The vendor could issue a conditional refund, eg an on-blockchain
        transaction for the amount of the coffee from them to you,
        payable if you ever receive the hash token. (And if you don't,
        redeemable by them after a timeout). That doesn't work real well
        if the fee for a blockchain txn is more than the price of a cup
        of tea of course.

> Assume neither the customer nor the tea shop are technically sophisticated
> -- assume the customer is using an SPV wallet and the tea shop is using a
> service similar to Bitpay.

IMHO, most of the complexity isn't in doing the transaction, it's in
maintaining the channels. For example:

 - what if the tea shop has a sudden run of customers, and all their
   payment channels fill up?

 - how do you close the till at the end of the day (ie, put your
   earnings into a cold wallet so they can't be hacked as easily and
   clear your channel so you can accept more payments tomorrow?) Do you
   do this on the blockchain or do you have a different lightning
   network channel to your "bank account"?

 - inversely; if you do all your weekly shopping and impulse buys (tea,
   coffee, beer, meals, groceries, fuel, road tolls, ...) on lightning,
   how do you reset your channels once a day/week/fortnight/month with
   some money from your salary/savings, so they don't run out?

 - do refunds work, even after the original txn has finished? ("Oh,
   actually we're out of tea")

 - you have to watch the blockchain once a week or so in case your
   counterparty tries stealing your balance by replaying old states and
   hoping you don't notice

 - how do you keep the channel keys/secrets sufficiently available
   and secure?

 - how do you figure out who to make channels with in the first place,
   and if/when to change them?

 - what happens if your phone breaks, is stolen or gets lost; have you
   lost your channel secrets, and potentially all the coins in your
   balance?

 - etc.

(I don't think they're unsolvable or anything, though)

Cheers,
aj

Hi Anthony,

No belief can be shown to be universally held, and an appeal to
authority is also a logical fallacy for good reason.

The blog you quote is littered with flawed economic ideas. It's become a
pet peeve of mine that people refer to mining (and/or validation) as a
"tragedy of the commons" problem, or a "public good" subject to a "free
rider" problem. This betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of both
money and Bitcoin.

I'm not commenting on the other merits of your argument or others in
this thread, I mean just to dispute the validity of this particular
reference. Even the portion you quoted is quite absurd:

>> "We?re not spending so much on mining because we really need it.
>> It?s because printing money distorts behaviour."

We don't "really need" to prevent "printing money" - Bitcoin could
somehow get by without that constraint? Preventing the printing of money
is the only reason that Bitcoin exists.

The tragedy of the commons scenario properly applies only to property
controlled by the state. In the quoted blog the analogy is so misapplied
that it fundamentally misrepresents the forces at work in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not at all "like a lighthouse". State run lighthouses are
financed via taxation. That may be taxation of anything, whether or not
related to the shipping the lighthouse purports to protect. It may in
fact protect no shipping at all, since payment is generally completely
divorced from benefit, and the benefits may be completely divorced from
shipping. For example, preservation of jobs for lighthouse keepers and
the Coast Guard, or even nostalgia. Just as with a private grazing
field, a truly private lighthouse would not have a "commons problem" at all.

Bitcoin mining is financed by a fixed schedule of inflation and
transaction fees. State inflation is a tax on all holders of currency
and a form of default on state debt. This and other taxes fund
lighthouses. A tax is the seizure of someone else's property through
force. Bitcoin inflation is predictable, so the inflation cost is
factored in to its value before it is acquired, according to the
depreciation schedule, just like bond valuation for example. This means
it is NOT a tax, is merely a cost that is paid to miners for use of
their security services.

Bitcoin transaction "fees" are not fees in the state use-fee (taxation)
sense, since the fees are priced based on voluntary trade. The blog
misinterprets who is paying the cost of securing a transaction when it
claims, "it's the sender who pays." Both parties to a transaction bear
the cost of using any given medium of exchange. If the receiver is
concerned about double spending risk, it's the sender who will have to
compensate with time and/or money. But this is just as much a cost to
the receiver as it has raised the effective price of his sales with the
difference in money accruing to the third party.

Finally, transaction fees *are* mining contracts. Creating *another*
system of mining contracts initiated by a receiver would do nothing to
change the economics, but it would significantly complicate the
implementation (raising costs generally). The cost of paying a mining
contract would of course be paid by the sender, in terms of increased
price charged by the receiver.

I believe that a fundamental misunderstanding of the important
distinction between voluntary trade and state-controlled trade is
underpinning a lot of confusion and misunderstanding with respect to the
block size debate. Bitcoin does not have a commons problem specifically
because it's designed to resist state control. It's only in the loss of
that independence that such a problem would arise (and effectively kill
Bitcoin altogether).

Ironically the desire to fix a non-existent commons problem in Bitcoin
seems to be a driving force behind what may in fact weaken its only
defence against eventually becoming a commons.

Thats exactly what I argued makes no sense to me.

Why pay for something you don't need? Paying something Just because you have 
money is really not a good business strategy. I doubt that will happen.

Sigh, kanzure on irc points out I misread this -- I read "on-channel"
not "on-chain".

In that case, I think the answer is "the customer doesn't pay for tea
via lightning". They have to setup a channel with someone first, and
to do that, they'll need a "sufficiently confirmed" anchor transaction,
and I don't think zero confirmations would be enough for that.

So:

 -1 "Oh, how did that guy pay for tea with his phone? That's cool!"
    "Scan the QR code, yeah, where the lightning logo is"
    "Cool, I'll try it tomorrow"

 0 go home, "open a lightning channel", sleep, look forward to getting
   tea tomorrow

For step 0, I guess it's:

 0.1 "Choose a hub to connect to" (could be randomly selected)
 0.2 "Choose an amount to fund the channel" (0.5 btc would be a lot)
 0.3 "Are you sure?"
 0.4 [wait briefly while counterparty signs]
 0.5 [wait for 10 confirmations?]

I don't think it's at all clear how 0.1 works in practice yet -- routing
has barely been spitballed, and without knowing how routing works, it's
hard to say who to connect to.

Hard to say how much to put in in step 0.2 too -- if it takes a while to
refresh funds in a channel (you have to do a blockchain txn eg), then
that you should put more in; if you have multiple channels for whatever
reason, maybe you can put less in each.

The "Are you sure?" might require some legal T&Cs in practice.

You need to have some realtime communication with your channel
counterpary when creating the anchor; but that should be fairly quick.
You also need to establish some random numbers and keys, but those could
be done in advance.

I think you (or your counterparty) will want to wait for a few
confirmations before your channel is actually usable. So I think it'll
take over an hour for a channel to be "open" in even the best case.

Cheers,
aj

In terms of usage I think you'd more imagine a wallet that basically
parks Bitcoins onto channels at all times, so long as they are
routable there is no loss, and the scalability achieved thereby is
strongly advantageous, and there is even the potential for users to
earn fees by having their wallets participate in channel rebalancing
(where hubs pay users to rebalance channels - end up with the same net
position but move funds from one user-owned channel to another.)
Exchange deposit, withdrawal, payments, even in-exchange trades can
usefully happen in lightning for faster, cheaper more scalable
transactions.

Agreed.

yes, and thats fine.


The argument that Adam was making was the other extreme; that Bitcoin was 
useless the moment he has to trust any 3rd party.
And that is why I started this thread, because that idea that Bitcoin looses 
its functionality when you deviate from the trust-no-one path, is destructive.


For instance I suggested a week ago that the Chinese firewall (blocksize 
propagation) problem could maybe be solved by having a chinese miner partially 
trust some full nodes on Internet hubs. For instance in Amsterdam, one in 
Stockholm, etc.
And then propagation of a newly mined block would make the miner only sent the 
header to this server where a full x-MB block is then created by some 
specialized software that bases it on the mempool of its bitcoind.

Propagation of a Chinese miner then suddenly doesn't care about blocksize when 
hopping over the chinese firewall. You'd only send a small amount of data, 
likely around 20Kb for even 8Mb blocks.

A critic would argue its a useless strategy because you'd have to trust the 
data center operators.
I'd argue that its a risk, for sure, but one that can be mitigated easily by 
having various datacenters around the world where you'd run your software so 
you'd be able to check the validity of each.

Risks can only be assessed fairly if people are less black/white in their 
thinking.

I love that about Bitcoin, it combines technical specialized thinking with 
Economics and planning. If you don't have both, you probably end up rejecting 
the best ideas.


> Adam, I think he means a multisig escrow transaction where the escrow
> is trusted by both parties, and other examples like that.

Yes, thats one example. Thanks Jorge!

A similar but relevant example would be like the M-Pesa example.
People that have a phone but not a smart phone can choose to have their 
private keys stored at a trusted company in their own country. Some payments 
can be off-chain, but as soon as you deal with people outside of this small 
community they would be on-chain.

When we are talking about remittances, this means one of the two parties does 
not have an account at the trusted party and as such this will be an on-chain 
transaction.
Same for a farmer in Nairobi buying equipment from a company in Cairo, or a 
Internet startup in Kampala/Uganda selling services to users in Europe and 
those users send their payments on-chain.

All of these examples are about the largest group of people in the world; the 
unbanked. Bitcoin could mean a huge change to these people and I care a lot 
about this usecase. We need bigger bocks for these usecases as LN will not do 
anything for them.

I think you are drawing a disction that does not exist; rather it's a
disagreement about terminology.

If a system exists that provides high confidence of faithful behavior
even from malicious parties, then it's one this community would call
"trustless" (assuming the security properties are strong enough).
The result is a system where it's possible to trust everyone.

Trust in this case has multiple meanings.   In one meaning trust is an
(well founded) expectation of faithful behavior.  In another it is a
blind reliance.   When "trust everyone" is used, it's speaking to the
first definition, when the trustless definition is used it's referring
to the second defintion-- without blind faith.

A trustless (second def) system allows its users to trust (first def)
everyone, even the inherently untrustworthy (second def).  In doing
so, the considerable cost and inequality created by the maintaince of
trust (second definition) relations is mitigated, and the availablity
of faithful performance increased.  Doing so is a prerequsite to
having a strongly decenteralized system, because otherwise trust
requiremets drive the enviroment towards natural monopolies (as it's
cheaper and more effective for more people to trust (second def) a
smaller number of parties.

Less philosophically, if you're willing to have systems defined by
trust (first definition) (e.g. you do not believe that what I descibed
above coveys value, or hope that witl a small number of very trusted
parties external factors will transform blind faith into a rational
expectation of faithful performance) then there are _much_ more
technically superior ways to structure a system than Bitcoin does
today-- ones that acheive much greater performance, flexibility,
reliablity, and better security (ignoring any insecurity that arises
as a result of the trusted parties strong assumptions).

If one wants to layer trust based things on top of a trust mitigating
framework, they can do so-- and enjoy efficiencies from doing so.
Doing the converse doesn't appear really possible.

Everyone in any industry will consider that a bad thing.

There is no doubt that on-chain transactions will grow, absolutely no doubt.
You can direct many people to off-chain systems, but that will not stop growth 
of on-chain transactions. Bitcoin economy is absolutely tiny and there is a 
huge amount of growth possible.  It can only grow.

Naturally, that is a usecase.  But not really one that enters my mind. It 
certainly is not a requirement to have guaranteed time.

The situation is much simpler than that.
We have maybe 0,007% of the world population using Bitcoin once a month. (half 
a million people).  And I'm being very optimistic with that number...
This should give you an idea of how much growth is possible.

There is no doubt at all that the 1Mb blocks will get full, continuously, if 
we get to a higher rate of usage. Even with the vast majority of users using 
Bitcoin off-chain.

As such its not about a guaranteed time-to confirmation. Its about a 
confirmation before I die.

> If you want transactions to be cheap, it will also be cheap to make them
> unreliable.

Its not about transactions being cheap. The fee market is completely 
irrelevant to the block size. If you think otherwise you are delusional.
The reason it is irrelevant is because when the system starts consistently 
dropping transactions when user count goes up, and when that happens the 
Bitcoin network looses value because people don't put value in something that 
is unreliable.

This is simple economy 101.
Look at history; so many great companies made great products that had more 
features, but didn't make it because their competition might have been slower 
to market, but it was actually reliable.

What I'm saying is that this ratio may have improved 20x since miners began
using the TheBlueMatt relay network, so deteriorating the ratio 2x does not
put miners in a unknown future, but in an future which is far better than
the state they were a year ago.

But SPV mining has improved the ratio another 2x (because headers can be
pushed even faster, fit in a single network packet, and can do without
inv/getdata round-trips because they basically "pay" for the bandwidth
usage by its own proof of work).
With a better wire protocol you can "propagate" a 10 MB block faster that
the time it takes currently to propagate an empty block.
So 10x deterioration of the ratio would be still something acceptable.

I'm not saying it's a good thing. I'm saying that it's impossible to avoid.
It's a real incentive. It must exists so Bitcoin is incentive compatible.
We can talk for hours and hours and we won't prevent miners from doing it.
I predicted it back in 2013, without even being a miner myself. It's here
to stay. Forever. It's a pity Greg chose that awful name of "SPV" mining
instead some cool name like "Instant" mining that we could market as
Bitcoin latest feature :)

Do you consider the TheBlueMatt relay network a "good thing". NO! It's a
very bad centralization thing, but it is unavoidable. I would like the
relay network to be embedded on the standard network protocol, using local
route optimizations to reduce latency for block propagation (there is one
old paper on this, and it says that with local prioritization you can have
a lower bound to get a propagation latency of at most two times the optimal
value (possibly generated by the minimum spanning tree)).

It requires trust between miners that know eachother, and fundamentally
> breaks the security assumption of SPV clients...

No is does not. The incentive follows directly from the cheating cost (the
subsidy). Even if I don't know you, I know you wouldn't waste 25 BTC to try
to cheat me for 25 BTC with a probability of 1/100, that's for sure. On
average, you loose 24.75 BTC per cheat attempt.

"SPV" mining is safe as long as it is done for a certain bounded period of
time and bounded number of blocks (e.g: 30 seconds from that last validated
block, and no more than 1 non-validated block). SPV clients that accept a
transaction with 1 confirmation are already in danger of orphaning, and
long invalid "SPV" mining chain forks (as occurred last month) should never
had occurred if limits were in-place.

SPV mining incentive will stay until there is no subsidy, as many other
incentives. SPV mining also must be there to prevent malicious actors from
DoS-ing the relay network. If it's there, then the DoS incentive disappears.

Let's code "instant" mining into Bitcoin Core, and do it right.

Also as Michael Rudy points out, higher block rate means lower variance,
and that's good for miners. Last, as I already said, having a lower average
block interval strengthens Bitcoin value proposition, so miners would be
delighted that their bitcoins are more worthy.

Would it be an idea to create a generator of transactions on the test network 
that a large number of people can run? Using some randomization as well as the 
actual estimation code would generate some reasonably useful data.

I'd volunteer my node to run that.

The actual fee is irrelevant, the amount of transactions is relevant.

Have you ever been to a concert that was far away from public transport? They 
typically set up bus shuttles, or taxis to get people back into town 
afterwards.
The result there is always you end up waiting forever and it actually may be 
easier to just walk instead of wait.
The amount you pay is irrelevant if everyone is paying it. There still is more 
demand than there is capacity.

At the concert the amount of people will stop after some time, and you'd get 
your bus. But in the scenarios created here the queues will never stop.

So, no, its not unreliable for cheap free transactions.
Its unreliable for all types of transactions.

So yes, better relay protocols (whether you consider "SPV mining" a form of
that or not) reduce the effect of the block size. That does not give any
benefit for reduced interblock times.

Your argument seems to be "centralization pressure is not bad now, because
it already improved a lot... so we can make it worse again by reducing
interblock time"? I disagree that it is not bad, and shorter blocks have
other downsides which were already mentioned.

of "SPV" mining instead some cool name like "Instant" mining that we could

The SPV security assumption is that no hashrate majority will collude in
order to make my transactions incorrectly look confirmed.

With validation-less mining, even a 0.1% hashrate that is part of a group
with 60% hashrate is enough to make that happen.

Of course they won't intentionally do that. No other miner would agree to
do validation-less mining with them again, making it harder for them to
compete. So it is not permissionless: you get higher profitability by
making an agreement with the largest hashrate. I think that is a much worse
centralization effect than having an optional centralized relay network
available... there could even be multiple such networks.

if I don't know you, I know you wouldn't waste 25 BTC to try to cheat me

loose 24.75 BTC per cheat attempt.

Per cheat attempt, or per bug.

I thought about this too. Since headers-first it would be trivial to do: if
our best header is ahead of our best block, hand out an empty template in
createblocktemplate, and we're done.

Unfortunately, Greg Maxwell pointed out that this (even with a time limit)
amplifies selfish mining, since I can propagate headers before propagating
blocks, in order to make others temporarily work on top of my chain.

Only a small constant factor, but yes.

That's an incorrect analogy. You choose the rate you pay, and get higher
priority when you pay more. Taxi drivers can't pick out higher-paying
customers in advance.

A better comparison is Uber, which charges more in places with high demand,
and you can accept or refuse in advance. And yes, it remains reliable if
you're among those with the highest willingness to pay.

> So, no, its not unreliable for cheap free transactions.
> Its unreliable for all types of transactions.

If 2500 transactions fit in the block chain per day (assuming constant
size) and there are less than 2500 per hour that pay at least 0.001 BTC in
fee, then any transaction which pays more than 0.001 BTC will have a very
high chance of getting in a small multiple of one hour, since miners
prioritize by feerate.

If there are in addition to that 5000 transactions per hour which pay less,
then yes, they need to compete for the remaiming space and their
confirmation will be unreliable.

The whole point is that whether confirmation at a particular price point is
reliable depends on how much demand there is at that price point. And
increasing the block size out of fear of what might happen is failing to
recognize that it can always happen that there is a sudden change in demand
that outcompetes the rest.

The point is not that evolution towards a specific higher feerate needs to
happen, but an evolution to an ecosystem that accepts that there is never a
guarantee for reliability, unless you're willing to pay more than everyone
else - whatever that number is.

I'm sorry, I missed your "if everyone is paying it". This changes a lot. I
agree with you: if everyone wants to pay much then it becomes unreliable.

But I don't think that is something we can avoid with a small constant
factor block size increase, and we don't do the world a service by making
it look like it works for longer.

Let's grow within bounderies set by technology and centralization pressure
that we can agree on. Let the market decide whether how they will that will
low volume reliable transactions and/or high volume unreliable ones.

Lightning doesn't solve the key exchange problem (perhaps something like
Namecoin will help in the future). Bitcoin faces this problem today. How
do you know the bitcoin address belongs to the recipient without
trusting CAs? What if, in the case of the majority of bitcoin payments
today, the bitcoin address was not signed and the recipient claimed to
have never received their funds? There should be signed proof of payment
in every transaction for this reason.

There are some incentives towards keeping the system functional via
fees. If you attempt to flood the system, you'll likely be paying some
fees -- someone running a node will not interpret it as an attack, as
they're getting some money (probabably substantially higher as they will
increase fees to ensure network availability).

I agree that it's very important to think through varius attack models.

I'm going to go with this one, since we are seeking common ground and all of 
this makes sense to me. And I bet to Gavin would agree to this too.

The question I want to ask is this;

How do you expect to get from the current to the situation outlined above?

There are several market forces at work;

* people currently expect near-free payments.
* people currently expect zero-confirmations.
* Bitcoin is seeing a huge amount of uptake, popularity, etc.
* With Greece still in flux, there is a potential enormous spike of usage set 
to come when (not if) the Euro falls.


I conclude that we need;

* to create and make working solutions like LN, sidechains etc etc etc.
This should allow people to get their fast confirmation time. Who cares its of 
a different nature, the point is that the coffeeshop owner lets you leave with 
your coffee. We can sell that.

* To buy ourselves time, LN is not done, Bitpay and friends work on-chain. 
That won't change for a year at least.
We need to move the max-block size to a substantial bigger size to allow 
Bitcoin to grow.


Unfortunately for us all, Bitcoin is over-sold. We don't have a sales 
department but the worth-of-mouth leaves us in a bad situation. And we need to 
react to make sure the product isn't killed by bad publicity. What Gox didn't 
manage can certainly happen when people find out that Bitcoin can't currently 
do any of the things everyone is talking about.
So, while LN is written, rolled out and tested, we need to respond with bigger 
blocks.  8Mb - 8Gb sounds good to me.

Can everyone win?

Yes, it only gets bad when fees become "high."

I'll skip over the discussion of the pros/cons I listed since that mostly
appeared for illustrative purposes and I don't have a strong disagreement
with anything you said.

My sense is that the people arguing for a hard fork now tend to envision
"hitting the limit" as tx fees being fairly high, and those arguing against
a hard fork envision tx fees staying low when 1 MB blocks start to get
full. Which of those occurs depends on how quickly and in what manner
Bitcoin gains popularity. Even if I thought there's an 95% chance that
there would be no sudden jump in Bitcoin tx demand, I would want to have
some rough plan in place for that other 5% when some previously difficult
use case becomes viable and demand spikes. Do those arguing for the "wait
and see" approach not think that a quick increase in demand is even likely
enough to warrant discussing what we'd do in that case? Greg Maxwell
mentioned doubling the max block size if there was ever a standing backlog (
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/007880.html
-- I think fee level is a better metric than size of tx backlog), but I
haven't seen other devs comment on it.

The question is about what you'd do in the absence of those details that
you don't have. Imagine that fees spiked to $5/tx tomorrow. You have some
model of the situation that allows you to say that 1.01 MB is something
you'd support, and that's the model that I'm trying to understand. The
answers I gave are not ones I'm confident about. I'm sure if I studied this
for a week they'd change. I sense that devs are reluctant to answer this
question because it could be taken out of context or held against them
later. Or maybe they just don't like saying things that they don't have a
high level of confidence about on principle. IMO this reluctance
contributes to a lack of understanding of each other's positions. We all
have these imperfect models in our heads that we're basing our
disagreements on, but we won't show each other these models.

Sorry, I see how what I wrote was misleading. You've seen the email I'm
referring to. I was talking about when he defined the criteria he used
qualitatively and suggested that's how he arrived at 20 MB:
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/009971.html.
I think he talks about it in a little more detail elsewhere. I inferred
from that that he wouldn't support 40 MB or 80 MB, but that may be wrong.

I should also have given credit to Pieter, as he even more explicitly
specified a level where he'd turn into a hard fork advocate, via his own
hard fork proposal. Neither of these statements specifies exactly where the
switch-over point is, but they're the closest I've seen.

Don't you think the devs should have some rough plan that they discuss
ahead of time about what to do in the situation of high fees? Even if it
happened gradually -- suppose fees crept to 20 cents, then 50 cents, then
75 over the next year -- I don't think I've ever seen a discussion of how
that should be handled, and what sort of fees people regard as high enough
to justify considering a hard fork.

I think it would prevent many people from supporting an urgent hard fork if
they knew how the core devs would handle that situation (assuming there was
some willingness to increase the block size if fees got too high).

I see that 'special' feature of this market as more strongly supporting the
need to encourage fast adoption.

Let's say block rewards are $7000 per block, and we think this gives a good
level of security (as Bitcoin grows, we'll probably want a lot more).

Suppose a 1MB block can hold 2000 txns. Then to pay for the same level of
security we have right now with only tx fees, assuming 1 MB blocks, the
average tx fee would have to be $3.50. Now suppose blocks are 100 MB in the
future. The average tx fee is then only 3.5 cents. I think the former
situation will not actually work, and the only way that Bitcoin can survive
is to eventually get into something more like the later situation. Let me
know if you want me to delve into why. I'll just note that even Lightning
doesn't work well when tx fees are that high, because channels need to be
opened and closed pretty often and if my counterparty is uncooperative, his
making me pay $3.50 starts to actually hurt.

So if we accept that, we need to end up in a situation where we eventually
have lots of people making on-blockchain txns, and paying relatively small
fees. Encouraging lots of use and experimentation of Bitcoin between now
and then seems pretty important for reaching that goal.

We're in a race with the block reward halving schedule, to see if we can
get usage high enough to pay for security (while maintaining enough
decentralization) before all of the security burden falls on transactions.
If there aren't enough transactions at that time, the burden will be too
high (or security will be too low) and people will find other solutions.

We seem to disagree about how hard it'll be to change wallet and node
software to cope with a fee market. As I've said I don't see very small
nonzero fees (for instance one tenth of a cent) as a problem though. So if
a solution that traded off usage and decentralization in a way that I
agreed with could be modified to ensure a fee market developed soon with
very low fees, I'd still support it.

This is where things diverge. It's fine to pick a new limit or growth
trajectory. But defend it with data and reasoned analysis.

Can you at least understand the conservative position here? "1MB sounds
good to me" is how we got into this mess. We must make sure that we avoid
making the same mistakes again, creating more or worse problems then we are
solving.

We currently serve about 0,007% of the world population sending maybe one 
transaction a month.
This can only go up.

There are about 20 currencies in the world that are unstable and showing early 
signs of hyperinflation. If even small percentage of these people cash-out and 
get Bitcoins for their savings you'd have the amount of people using Bitcoin 
as savings go from maybe half a million to 10 million in the space of a couple 
of months. Why so fast? Because all the world currencies are linked. 
Practically all currencies follow the USD, and while that one may stay robust 
and standing, the linkage has been shown in the past to cause chain-effects.

It is impossible to predict how much uptake Bitcoin will take, but we have 
seen big rises in price as Cyprus had a bailin and then when Greece first 
showed bad signs again.
Lets do our due diligence and agree that in the current world economy there 
are sure signs that people are considering Bitcoin on a big scale. 

Bigger amount of people holding Bitcoin savings won't make the transaction 
rate go up very much, but if you have feet on the ground you already see that 
people go back to barter in countries like Poland, Ireland, Greece etc.
And Bitcoin will be an alternative to good to ignore.  Then transaction rates 
will go up. Dramatically.

If you are asking for numbers, that is a bit tricky. Again; we are at 
0,007%... Thats like a f-ing rounding error in the world economy. You can't 
reason from that. Its like using a float to do calculations that you should 
have done in a double and getting weird output.


Bottom line is that a maximum size of 8Mb blocks is not that odd. Because a 20 
times increase is very common in a "company" that is about 6 years old.
For instance Android was about that age when it started to get shipped by non-
Google companies. There the increase was substantially bigger and the company 
backing it was definitely able to change direction faster than the Bitcoin 
oiltanker can change direction.


On the other side, 3Tb harddrives are sold, which take 8Mb blocks without 
problems.
You can buy broadband in every relevant country that easily supports the 
bandwidth we need. (remember we won't jump to 8Mb in a day, it will likely 
take at least 6 months).
We should get the inverted bloom filters stuff (or competing products) working 
at least on a one-to-one basis so we can solve the propagation time problem.
There frankly is a huge amount of optimization that can be done in that area, 
we don't even use locality (pingtime) to optimize distribution..
>From my experience you can expect a 2-magnitude speedup in that same 6 month 
period by focusing some research there.



Another metric to remember; if you follow hackernews (well, the incubator more 
than the linked articles) you'd be exposed to the thinking of these startups.
Their only criteria is growth. and this is rather substantial growth. Like 
150% per month.  Naturally, most of these build on top of html or other 
existing technologies.  But the point is that exponential growth is expected 
in any startup.  They typically have a much much more agressive timeline, 
though. Every month instead of every year.
Having exponential growth in the blockchain is really not odd and even if we 
have LN or sidechains or the next changetip, this space will be used. And we 
will still have scarcity.

Remember 8Gb/block still doesn't support VISA/Mastercard.

I'm sorry, I really don't want to sound like a jerk, but not a single word
of that mattered. Yes we all want Bitcoin to scale such that every person
in the world can use it without difficulty. However if that were all that
we cared about then I would be remiss if I did not point out that there are
plenty of better, faster, and cheaper solutions to finding global consensus
over a payment ledger than Bitcoin. Architectures which are algorithmically
superior in their scaling properties. Indeed they are already implemented
and you can use them today:

https://www.stellar.org/
http://opentransactions.org/

So why do I work on Bitcoin, and why do I care about the outcome of this
debate? Because Bitcoin offers one thing, and one thing only which
alternative architectures fundamentally lack: policy neutrality. It can't
be censored, it can't be shut down, and the rules cannot change from
underneath you. *That* is what Bitcoin offers that can't be replicated at
higher scale with a SQL database and an audit log.

It follows then, that if we make a decision now which destroys that
property, which makes it possible to censor bitcoin, to deny service, or to
pressure miners into changing rules contrary to user interests, then
Bitcoin is no longer interesting. We might as well get rid of mining at
that point and make Bitcoin look like Stellar or Open-Transactions because
at least then we'd scale even better and not be pumping millions of tons of
CO2 into the atmosphere from running all those ASICs.

Neither one of those assertions is clear. Keep in mind the goal is to have
Bitcoin survive active censorship. Presumably that means being able to run
a node even in the face of a hostile ISP or government. Furthermore, it
means being location independent and being able to move around. In many
places the higher the bandwidth requirements the fewer the number of ISPs
that are available to service you, and the more visible you are.

It may also be necessary to be able to run over Tor. And not just today's
Tor which is developed, serviced, and supported by the US government, but a
Tor or I2P that future governments have turned hostile towards and actively
censor or repress. Or existing authoritative governments, for that matter.
How much bandwidth would be available through those connections?

It may hopefully never be necessary to operate under such constraints,
except by freedom seeking individuals within existing totalitarian regimes.
However the credible threat of doing so may be what keeps Bitcoin from
being repressed in the first place. Lose the capability to go underground,
and it will be pressured into regulation, eventually.

To the second point, it has been previously pointed out that large miners
stand to gain from larger blocks, for the same basic underlying reasons as
selfish mining. The incentive is to increase blocks, and miners are able to
do so at will and without cost. I would not be so certain that we wouldn't
see large blocks sooner than that.

This is basically already deployed thanks to Matt's relay network. Further
improvements are not going to have dramatic effects.

No, it doesn't. And 8GB/block is ludicrously large -- it would absolutely,
without any doubt destroy the very nature of Bitcoin, turning it into a
fundamentally uninteresting reincarnation of the existing financial system.
And still be unable to compete with VISA/Mastercard.

So why then the pressure to go down a route that WILL lead to failure by
your own metrics?

I humbly suggest that maybe we should play the strengths of Bitcoin instead
-- it's trustlessness via policy neutrality.

Either that, or go work on Stellar. Because that's where it's headed
otherwise.

Bitcoin Scalability Workshops

In recent months the Bitcoin development community has faced difficult
discussions of how to safely improve the scalability and decentralized
nature of the Bitcoin network. To aid the technical consensus building
process we are organizing a pair of workshops to collect technical
criteria, present proposals and evaluate technical materials and data with
academic discipline and analysis that fully considers the complex tradeoffs
between decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. This
may be considered as similar in intent and process to the NIST-SHA3 design
process where performance and security were in a tradeoff for a security
critical application.

Since Bitcoin is a P2P currency with many stakeholders, it is important to
collect requirements as broadly as possible, and through the process
enhance everyone?s understanding of the technical properties of Bitcoin to
help foster an inclusive, transparent, and informed process.

Those with technical interest are invited to participate in this pair of
workshops with the following intent:

Phase 1: Scene setting, evaluation criteria, and tradeoff analysis.

Montreal, Canada: September 12th-13th, 2015

Scalability is not a single parameter; there are many opportunities to make
the Bitcoin protocol more efficient and better able to service the needs of
its growing userbase. Each approach to further scaling the Bitcoin
blockchain involves implicit trade offs of desired properties of the whole
system. As a community we need to raise awareness of the complex and subtle
issues involved, facilitate deeper research and testing of existing
proposals, and motivate future work in this area.

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the general tradeoffs and
requirements of any proposal to scale Bitcoin beyond its present limits.
Session topics are to include the presentation of experimental data
relating to known bottlenecks of Bitcoin?s continued growth and analysis of
implicit tradeoffs involved in general strategies for enabling future
growth.

This event will not host sessions on the topic of any specific proposals
involving changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Such proposals would be the
topic of a 2nd, follow-on Phase 2 workshop described below; this event is
intended to ?set the stage? for work on and evaluation of specific
proposals in the time between the workshops.

Phase 2 will be planned out further as part of Phase 1 with input from the
participants.

Phase 2: Presentation and review of technical proposals, with simulation,
benchmark results.

Hong Kong, SAR, China: TBD Nov/Dec 2015

Hopefully to be easier for the Chinese miners to attend, the second
workshop pertaining to actual block size proposals is to be planned for
Hong Kong roughly in the late November to December timeframe.

The purpose of this workshop is to present and review actual proposals for
scaling Bitcoin against the requirements gathered in Phase 1. Multiple
competing proposals will be presented, with experimental data, and compared
against each other. The goal is to raise awareness of scalability issues
and build a pathway toward consensus for increasing Bitcoin?s transaction
processing capacity or, barring that, identify key areas of further
required research and next steps for moving forward.

Preliminarily, Phase 2 will be a time to share results from experiments
performed as a result of Phase 1 and an opportunity to discuss new
developments.

How do the Workshops work?

   -

   Both events will be live-streamed with remote participation facilitated
   via IRC for parallel online discussion and passing questions to the event.
   -

   These workshops aim to facilitate the existing Bitcoin Improvement
   Proposals (BIP)[1] process. Most work will be done outside of the workshops
   in the intervening months. The workshops serve to be additive to the design
   and review process by raising awareness of diverse points of view, studies,
   simulations, and proposals.
   -

   Travel, venue details, and accommodation recommendation are available at
   scalingbitcoin.org. Registration begins August 12th at an early-bird
   ticket price of $150 USD until September 3rd. The ticket prices do not come
   close to covering the venue expense and travel subsidies, hence the need
   for corporate sponsors.
   -

   Please see the FAQ at scalingbitcoin.org which should answer most other
   questions.


Travel Subsidies for Independent/Academic Researchers

There will be an application process for independent or academic
researchers to apply for travel assistance to help cover the expense of
airfare and hotel fees up to $1,000 per qualified presenter who intends to
give a presentation.  The four underwriters of this event have agreed to
jointly review applications and cover the travel subsidies for qualified
presenters. See scalingbitcoin.org for details.

Sponsors of the Montreal Workshop

The first workshop is hosted and with logistics handled by the Montreal
consultancy CryptoMechanics <http://cryptomechanics.com>.

The Underwriters jointly responsible for venue expenses and researcher
travel subsidies are currently the MIT Digital Currency Initiative,
Chaincode Labs, Blockstream, and Chain.com.

Current sponsors include: Cryptsy, BitcoinTalk, Final Hash, Blockstream,
MIT DCI, Chaincode Labs, IDEO Futures, Kraken, and Chain.com.

Additional sponsors are needed. Please see scalingbitcoin.org for

Lightning will never catch on as it basically demands that everyone who
uses it to become a speculator. Payment hubs and merchants will be at the
mercy of the bitcoin price while their funds stay locked up in payment
channels. This idea is a dead-end.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Future Of Bitcoin-Cores Wallet
Message-ID: <55C9BA0F.60408@jonasschnelli.ch>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Hi
(excuse my english; it?s not my native language)

As you might noticed, bitcoin-cores wallet didn?t got that much focus
during the last month (even years?).
Wallet development has mostly moved towards SPV (bitcoinj), thin
clients (Electrum), centralized web middleware (Copay, Greenaddress,
etc.).

Obviously this direction was highly appreciated by users who now can
now run a bitcoin-client (SPV / thin client) on a smartphone or on a
computer with tiny available resources.

Full validation slowly gets a privilege of people who can manage to
run bitcoin-core on a VPS or different server like system.
Thought, i think, running a full node wallet could be end user
friendly with some changes in the current concept.

Today a standard user can download a 1080p 10GB movie over iTunes (in
background) and simultaneous play a CPU/GPU extensive 3D game on a
standard computer.
Why do people think (and it might is) running a full node is so painful?

Mainly it could be because bitcoin-core has been focused on doing
validation as quick as possible (okay for a server, not desirable for
a wallet background service).

I could see the following strategy:
- - end user focused full node wallet would have enabled pruning by
default (~2GB disk usage).
- - throttled validation (flexible CPU usage, user selectable, maybe
~20% by default).
- - throttled block download (bandwidth).
- - SPV during catch up (initial sync as also when catching up multiple
days because user/node was offline).
- - Disable bloom filtering if there is enough bandwith, keep blocks for
later validation.
- - when node is in sync, switch from SPV to full validation (maybe
maintain to lists/dbs of wtx or re-validate after full catchup and
display potential conflicts).
- - participate in p2p, but with limits/throttling (service limited
amount of blocks, tx [TBD]).

Why?
- - This could increase the amount of participating full nodes while
giving users more privacy and security.
- - Create a counterweight against SPV/thin clients (avoid wallet
development centralization, could be helpful once/if attacks agains
SPV/thin clients are becoming real).
- - Slowly complete full validation (can take ~1-2 weeks) and thereforce
increase privacy (avoid bloomfilters) and security.

What about SPV together with a full node?
Sounds good in theory. But who can run a full node (see above)? How is
the channel secured (against MITM, privacy) between the SPV client and
the trusted full node? How hard is it to setup and maintain a secure
tunnel between a smartphone SPV and a full node over the p2p (8333)
channel? How about examine the mempool for fee calculations and
(maybe) upcoming CPFP like approaches, etc.?

How about smartphones?
Obviously the above solution won?t probably work on a smartphone (to
much bandwidth and CPU usage). But do you carry your whole saving in
your physical wallet with you? Maybe a smartphone does hold keys which
protects low value / daily spendings like a physical wallet (=SPV okay).
My personal long term vision of that use-case is, that groups of
people who trust each other (a family, etc.) might run one or multiple
full node(s) on a hardened system (something similar to the bitnodes
hardware) where the system could serve smartphones over something like
a stratum server (electrum) or bitpays wallet-service does (index
blockchain, additional wallet services). Every member still holds it?s
keys but they trust the connected full node (full nodes does address
index, balance calculation, multisig arrangements and maybe even coin
selection).

Since about one year i slowly work toward this direction. It took me a
while to commit myself to a strategy (and i still shake from time to
time).
At the moment I am working on a wallet focused bitcoin-core fork with
the ability to re-merge it to the bitcoin-core branch (keep the fork
rebased).
Long term goal is, to decouple the both (wallet / core) by using
bitcoin-core as a library (static or shared) for the wallet side
(which is possible already now)

To myself: I work in the bitcoin-space full-time and completely
independent (not employed or influenced by a bitcoin related company)
with no business interest, though, i think the acquired know-how can
be valuable within the next serval years. And i won?t have any regrets
if my work turns out to be unless and ends up in trash.

I have set up this mail to avoid parallelism on a works stream (if
there is any). Of course i would really appreciate if other developers
are willing to join the team by reviewing, concept critism or
contributing code at https://github.com/jonasschnelli/bitcoin.

Any forms of criticism and any ideas are highly appreciated.

- policy neutrality.
- It can't be censored.
- it can't be shut down
- and the rules cannot change from underneath you.

except it can be shutdown the minute it actually gets used by its inability
to scale.

what's the point of having all this if nobody can use it?
what's the point of going through all that energy and CO2 for a mere 24,000
transactions an hour?

It's clear that it's just a matter of time before it collapses.

Here's a simple proposal (concept) that doesn't pretend to set a fixed
block size limit as you can't ever know the demands the future will bring
https://gist.github.com/gubatron/143e431ee01158f27db4

We don't need to go as far as countries with hyper inflation trying to use
the technology to make it collapse, anybody here who has distributed
commercial/free end user software knows that any small company out there
installs more copies in a couple weeks than all the bitcoin users we have
at the moment, all we need is a single company/project with a decent amount
of users who are now enabled to transact directly on the blockchain to
screw it all up (perhaps OpenBazaar this winter could make this whole thing
come down, hopefully they'll take this debate and the current limitations
before their release, and boy are they coding nonstop on it now that they
got funded), the last of your fears should be a malicious government trying
to shut you down, for that to happen you must make an impact first, for now
this is a silly game in the grand scheme of things.

And you did sound pretty bad, all of his points were very valid and they
share the concern of many people, many investors, entrepreneurs putting
shitload of money, time and their lives on a much larger vision than that
of a network that does a mere 3,500 tx/hour, but some people seem to be
able to live in impossible or useless ideals.

It's simply irresponsible to not want to give the network a chance to grow
a bit more. Miners centralizing is inevitable given the POW based
consensus, hobbists-mining is only there for countries with very cheap
energy.

If things remain this way, this whole thing will be a massive failure and
it will probably take another decade before we can open our mouths about
cryptocurrencies, decentralization and what not, and this stubornness will
be the one policy that censored everyone, that shutdown everyone, that made
the immutable rules not matter.

Perhaps it will be Stellar what ends up delivering at this stubborn pace.

Hey Jonas,

I think your analysis of what (some) users need is a good one.

We've discussed this before so I know you prefer your current approach, but
I personally would take a slightly different path to reach the same end:

   1. Support serving of SPV wallets from pruned storage. This means some
   protocol upgrades, BIPs, etc. It helps all SPV wallets, including on phones.
   2. Then make a bitcoinj based desktop wallet app, that contains a
   bundled bitcoind.
   3. Make the app sync TWO wallets simultaneously, one from the P2P
   network as today, and another from the local bitcoind via a local socket
   (or even just passing buffers around internally)
   4. The app should then switch from using the wallet synced to P2P to the
   wallet synced to localhost when the latter is fully caught up, and back
   again when the local node is behind.
   5. If there's a discrepancy, alert the user.

There are big advantages of taking this path! They are:

   - The switching back and forth between local full-security mode (which
   may be behind) and remote SPV security (fully synced) is instant and
   transparent to the user. This is important for laptop users who don't run a
   local node all the time. The different audit levels can be reflected in the
   UI in some way.

   - The bitcoinj wallet code already has support for things like
   multi-sig, BIP32, seed words, micropayment channels, etc. You can disable
   Bloom filtering if you like (download full blocks).

   - You can do a local RPC or JNI/JNA call to get fee estimates, if wanted.

   - The modern JVM tools and languages are much, much more productive than
   working with C++.


If you want a thing that runs a home server, then the best way to do that
IMO would be to bundle Tor and make it auto-register a Tor hidden service.
Then you can just define a QR code standard for 'pairing' a wallet to a
.onion address. Any bitcoinj based wallet can sync to it, and as it's your
own node, you can use a Bloom filter sized to give virtually no false
positives. No additional indexing is then required.

Fully agreed, and I like that a lot as well.

I think remembering the Internet architecture here is viable.
There is a saying that censorship on the internet is seen as a defect and 
route around. Bitcoin follows the same concept, and arguable is even better at 
it since transactions don't have to be delivered to the network in real time. 
It can be shipped by carrier pigeon in the extreme case ;)
Or though smileys over skype chat...

I understand your point, its a good one.

Here is my counter argument; countries (or states) that fail to legally get 
the bandwidth to do mining, are not an indicator for the success of Bitcoin.
Tor will work fine with a full node (or gnunet, if you want), just make sure 
you take the transmission delays into account.
And naturally, there is the point that actual end users don't need a full 
node. The system as a whole will work just fine for people in totalitarian 
regimes as long as 100% of the world doesn't reach that point.
With various nodes in Sealand (near the UK) and miners in China, the system 
would still work for users in New York.

Naturally, I was referring to the existing proposal that 8Gb blocks would be 
reached only in many years. Its a really long way away.

And if you read my previous replies on this thread you can see a more 
substantial argument which I'll make brief here;
I'm not suggesting we scale the blocksize to accomodate for the next 10 years 
of growth.
Instead I'm suggesting that we use solutions like Lightning and sidechains and 
anything people can invent as soon as possible.  But we need bigger blocks as 
well. Because not any single solution is the answer, we need a combination of 
multiple.

There really is no reason to suspect we can't actually increase the blocksize 
in some months as the first thing we do.

+1  Glad to see this work.

The Bitcoin Core wallet is a bit neglected these days - maintained but not
advancing.

If anyone feels that protecting those running full nodes from bitcoind
eating more and more memory this way is a good idea, I can make a BIP out
of it if that would help.

You are completely right: this problem has nothing to do with the consensus
block size maximum and it has to be solved regardless of what the maximum
is. No BIP is necessary for this. The "doing nothing side" has been working
on this too:

There's also an interesting question posted over at Reddit - will
Lightning payment hubs be treated as money transmitters in the US?

https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3gjnmd/lightning_may_not_be_a_scaling_solution/

A payment hub operator working with brand name merchants like Disney and
Gap would most likely adopt any licensing and AML/KYC regulations.

Some folk might thus find themselves forced to use anonymous hubs with
strict routing requirements to avoid commercial hubs.  Given the reduced
number of available channels, this could drive up lightning network fees
for those folk.

Of course, two parties can avoid any intermediary by using a regular
on-chain transaction, but it might not be feasible if Bitcoin is
operating as a settlement network with high transaction fees.

I've read them. I have read gavin's blog posts as well, several times.
I still don't see what else can we fear from not increasing the size apart
from fees maybe rising and making some problems that need to be solved
rewardless of the size more visible (like a dumb unbounded mempool design).

This discussion is frustrating for everyone. I could also say "This have
been explained many times" and similar things, but that's not productive.
I'm not trying to be obstinate, please, answer what else is to fear or
admit that all your feas are just potential consequences of rising fees.

With the risk of sounding condescending or aggressive...Really, is not that
hard to answer questions directly and succinctly. We should all be friends
with clarity. Only fear, uncertainty and doubt are enemies of clarity. But
you guys on the "bigger blocks side" don't want to spread fud, do you?
Please, prove paranoid people like me wrong on this point, for the good of
this discussion. I really don't know how else to ask this without getting a
link to something I have already read as a response.

Hi Jorge: Many people would like to participate in a global consensus
network -- which is a network where all the participating nodes are aware
of and agree upon every transaction. Constraining Bitcoin capacity below
the limits of technology will only push users seeking to participate in a
global consensus network to other solutions which have adequate capacity,
such as BitcoinXT or others. Note that lightning / hub and spoke do not
meet requirements for users wishing to participate in global consensus,
because they are not global consensus networks, since all participating
nodes are not aware of all transactions.

Michael, why does it matter that every node in the world process and
validate your morning coffee transaction? Why does it matter to anyone
except you and the coffee vendor?

You don't need consensus on the lightning network because you are
using bitcoin consensus anyway. Commitment transactions are deep
enough in the blockchain history that removing that transaction from
the history is impractical. The remaining guarantees are ensured by
the properties of the scripts in the transaction. You don't need to
see all the transactions, but you do need to look at the transactions
you are given and draw conclusions based on the details to see whether
their commitments are valid or the setup wasn't broken.

It generally doesn't matter that every node validate your coffee
transaction, and those transactions can and will probably be moved onto
offchain solutions in order to avoid paying the cost of achieving global
consensus. But you still don't get to set the cost of global consensus
artificially. Market forces will ensure that supply will meet demand there,
so if there is demand for access to global consensus, and technology exists
to meet that demand at a cost of one cent per transaction -- or whatever
the technology-limited cost of global consensus happens to be -- then
that's what the market will supply.

It would be like if Amazon suddenly said that they were going to be
charging $5 / gb / month to store data in s3. Can't do it. Technology
exists to bring about cloud storage at $0.01 / GB / month, so they don't
just get to set the price different from the capabilities of technology or
they'll get replaced by a competitor. Same applies to Bitcoin.

Lightning *depends* on global consensus in order to function. You can't use
it without a global consensus network at all. So given that there is
absolutely a place for a global consensus network, we need to decide
whether the cost to participate in that global consensus will be limited
above or below the capability of technology. In a world where anybody can
step up and fork the code, it's going to be hard for anyone to artificially
set the price of participating in global consensus at a rate higher than
what technology can deliver...

More people using Bitcoin does not necessarily mean more transactions being
processed by the block chain. Satoshi was forward-thinking enough to
include a powerful script-signature system, something which has never
really existed before. Though suffering from some limitations to be sure,
this smart contract execution framework is expressive enough to enable a
wide variety of new features without changing bitcoin itself.

One of these invented features is micropayment channels -- the ability for
two parties to rapidly exchange funds while only settling the final balance
to the block chain, and to do so in an entirely trustless way. Right now
people don't use scripts to do interesting things like this, but there is
absolutely no reason why they can't. Lightning network is a vision of a
future where everyone uses a higher-layer protocol for their transactions
which only periodically settle on the block chain. It is entirely possible
that you may be able to do all your day-to-day transactions in bitcoin yet
only settle accounts every other week, totaling 13kB per year. A 1MB block
could support that level of usage by 4 million people, which is many orders
of magnitude more than the number of people presently using bitcoin on a
day to day basis.

And that, by the way, is without considering as-yet uninvented applications
of existing or future script which will provide even further improvements
to scale. This is very fertile ground being explored by very few people.
One thing I hope to come out of this block size debate is a lot more people
(like Joseph Poon) looking at how bitcoin script can be used to enable new
and innovative resource-efficient and privacy-enhancing payment protocols.

The network has room to grow. It just requires wallet developers and other
infrastructure folk to step up to the plate and do their part in deploying
this technology.

I want to put a big thank-you out to Pindar, Warren, and others in the
organizing committee who I know must have put in a lot of hours to make
this happen. I will be attending, and I hope to see many of you there too.
It is my sincere hope that the academic structure of a workshop will help
break down some of the communication walls that have arisen in this debate,
and help us all work towards finding a compromise towards scaling bitcoin,
something we all want to see happen.

All things considered, if people want to participate in a global consensus
network, and the technology exist to do it at a lower cost, then is it
sensible or even possible to somehow arbitrarily set the price of
participating in a global consensus network to be expensive? Can someone
please walk me through how that's expected to play out because I'm really
having a hard time understanding how it could work.

because they are not global consensus networks, since all participating

Even if you are right, first fees will raise and that will be what pushes
people to other altcoins, no?
Can we agree that the first step in any potentially bad situation is
hitting the limit and then fees rising as a consequence?

Jorge, As long as Bitcoin remains the best global consensus network -- and
part of being best means being reasonably priced -- then no I don't think
people will be pushed into altcoins. Better money ultimately displaces
worse money, so I don't see a driving force for people to move to other
altcoins as long as Bitcoin remains competitive.

Hitting the limit in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing. The
question at hand is whether we should constrain that limit below what
technology is capable of delivering. I'm arguing that not only we should
not, but that we could not even if we wanted to, since competition will
deliver capacity for global consensus whether it's in Bitcoin or in some
other product / fork.

transaction, and those transactions can and will probably be moved onto
offchain solutions in order to avoid paying the cost of achieving global

artificially. Market forces will ensure that supply will meet demand there,
so if there is demand for access to global consensus, and technology exists
to meet that demand at a cost of one cent per transaction -- or whatever
the technology-limited cost of global consensus happens to be -- then
that's what the market will supply.

Assuming we maintain any block size maximum consensus rule, the market will
adapt to whatever maximum size is imposed by the consensus rules.
For example, with the current demand and the current consensus block size
maximum, the market has settled on a minimum fee of zero satoshis per
transaction. That's why I cannot understand the urgency to rise the maximum
size.

In any case, yhe consensus maximum shouldn't be based on current or
projected demand, only on centralization concerns, which is what the
consensus rule serves for (to limit centralization).
For example, Gavin advocates for 20 MB because he is not worried about how
that could increase centralization because he believes it won't.
I can't agree with that because I believe 20 MB could make mining
centralization (and centralization in general) much worse.

But if I have to chose between 2 "centralization safe" sizes, sure, the
bigger the better, why not.
In my opinion the main source of disagreement is that one: how the maximum
block size limits centralization.

The question is not what the technology can deliver. The question is what
price we're willing to pay for that. It is not a boolean "at this size,
things break, and below it, they work". A small constant factor increase
will unlikely break anything in the short term, but it will come with
higher centralization pressure of various forms. There is discussion about
whether these centralization pressures are significant, but citing that
it's artificially constrained under the limit is IMHO a misrepresentation.
It is constrained to aim for a certain balance between utility and risk,
and neither extreme is interesting, while possibly still "working".

Consensus rules are what keeps the system together. You can't simply switch
to new rules on your own, because the rest of the system will end up
ignoring you. These rules are there for a reason. You and I may agree about
whether the 21M limit is necessary, and disagree about whether we need a
block size limit, but we should be extremely careful with change. My
position as Bitcoin Core developer is that we should merge consensus
changes only when they are uncontroversial. Even when you believe a more
invasive change is worth it, others may disagree, and the risk from
disagreement is likely larger than the effect of a small block size
increase by itself: the risk that suddenly every transaction can be spent
twice (once on each side of the fork), the very thing that the block chain
was designed to prevent.

My personal opinion is that we should aim to do a block size increase for
the right reasons. I don't think fear of rising fees or unreliability
should be an issue: if fees are being paid, it means someone is willing to
pay them. If people are doing transactions despite being unreliable, there
must be a use for them. That may mean that some use cases don't fit
anymore, but that is already the case.

You didn't answer the 2 questions...
Anyway, if we don't care about centralization at all, we can just remove
the limit: that's what "technology can provide".
Maybe in that case it is developers who move to a decentralized
competitor...

I think everyone is expending huge effort on design, analysis and
implementation of the lowest cost technology for Bitcoin.

Changing parameters doesnt create progress on scalability fundamentals -
there really is an inherent cost and security / throughput tradeoff to
blockchains.  Security is quite central to this discussion.  It is
unrealistic in my opinion to suppose that everything can fit directly
on-chain in the fullest Bitcoin adoption across cash-payments, internet of
things, QoS, micropayments, share-trading, derivates etc.  Hence the
interest in protocols like lightning (encourage you and others to read the
paper, blog posts and implementation progress on the lightning-dev mailing
list).

Mid-term different tradeoffs can happen that are all connected to and
building on Bitcoin.  But whatever technologies win out for scale, they all
depend on Bitcoin security - anything built on Bitcoin requires a secure
base.  So I think it is logical that we strive to maintain and improve
Bitcoin security.  Long-term tradeoffs that significantly weaken security
for throughput or other considerations should be built on top of Bitcoin,
and avoiding creating a one-size fits all unfortunate compromise that
weakens Bitcoin to the lowest common denominator of centralisation,
insecurity and throughput tradeoffs.  This pattern (secure base, other
protocols built on top) is already the status quo - probably > 99% of
Bitcoin transactions are off-chain already (in exchanges, web wallets
etc).  And there are various things that can and are being done to improve
the security of those solutions, with provable reserves, periodic on-chain
settlement, netting, lightning like protocols and other things probably
still to be invented.

Some of the longer term things we probably dont know yet, but the future is
NOT bleak.  Lots of scope for technology improvement.

I'm not sure whether removing the limit at the protocol-level would lead to
government by miners who might reject blocks which were too big, but I
probably wouldn't want to take that risk. I think we should probably keep a
block size limit in the protocol, but that we should increase it to be as
high as "technology can provide." Toward that: I don't necessarily think
that node-count in and of itself should be the metric for evaluating what
technology can provide, as much as the goal that the chain be inexpensive
to validate given the capabilities of present technology -- so if I can
lease a server in a datacenter which can validate the chain and my total
cost to do that is just a few dollars, then we're probably ok.

Of course there's also the issue that we maintain enough geographic /
political distribution to keep the network reliable, but I think we're far
from being in danger on the reliability front. So maybe my criteria that
the chain be validated at low cost is the wrong focus, but if it is than
what's the appropriate criteria for deciding whether it's safe by standards
of "today's technology" to raise the limit at the protocol level?

The only reason why Bitcoin has grown the way it has, and in fact the only
reason why we're all even here on this mailing list talking about this, is
because Bitcoin is growing, since it's "better money than other money". One
of the key characteristics toward that is Bitcoin being inexpensive to
transact. If that characteristic is no longer true, then Bitcoin isn't
going to grow, and in fact Bitcoin itself will be replaced by better money
that is less expensive to transfer.

So the importance of this issue cannot be overstated -- it's compete or die
for Bitcoin -- because people want to transact with global consensus at
high volume, and because technology exists to service that want, then it's
going to be met. This is basic rules of demand and supply. I don't
necessarily disagree with your position on only wanting to support
uncontroversial commits, but I think it's important to get consensus on the
criticality of the block size issue: do you agree, disagree, or not take a
side, and why?

I dont think Bitcoin being cheaper is the main characteristic of
Bitcoin.  I think the interesting thing is trustlessness - being able
to transact without relying on third parties.

tell that to people in poor countries, or even in first world countries.
The competitive thing here is a deal breaker for a lot of people who have
no clue/don't care for decentralization, they just want to send money from
A to B, like email.

Re: "In my opinion the main source of disagreement is that one: how the
maximum block size limits centralization."

I generally agree with that, but I would add that centralization is only a
goal insofar as it serves things like reliability, transaction integrity,
capacity, and accessibility. More broadly: how do you think that moving the
block size from 1MB to 8MB would materially impact these things?

Re: "That's why I cannot understand the urgency to rise the maximum size."

This issue is urgent because the difference between bitcoin being a success
and it being forgotten hinges on it being "better money" than other money.
If people want a money that can process lots and lots of transactions at
low cost, they're going to get it so long as technology can give it to
them. While it's not critical we raise the block size this very moment
since we're not hitting the capacity wall right now, based on the way
growth spikes in Bitcoin have occurred in the past we, may hit that
capacity wall soon and suddenly. And the moment we do, then Bitcoin may no
longer be "better money" since there's a big opportunity for other money
with higher throughput and lower fees to take its place.

Then they also don't need their transactions to be on the blockchain, right?

So if they dont care about decentralisation, they'll be happy using
cheaper off-chain systems, right?

Bitcoin would be better money than current money even if it were a bit more
expensive to transact, simply because of its other great characteristics
(trustlessness, limited supply, etc). However... it is not better than
something else sharing all those same characteristics but which is also
less expensive. The best money will win, and if Bitcoin doesn't increase
capacity then it won't remain the best.

Sure, most people probably would be happy with cheaper off-chain systems.
There already are and will probably continue to be more transactions
happening off-chain partly for this very reason. That's not the issue we're
trying to address though: The main chain is the lynch-pin to the whole
system. We've got to do a good job meeting demand that people have for
wanting to utilize the main-chain, or else we'll risk being replaced by
some other main-chain solution that does it better.

If it is less expensive, it is harder to be reliable (because it's easier
for a sudden new use case to outbid the available space), which is less
useful for a payment mechanism.

If it has better scale (with the same technology), it will have higher
centralization pressure. The higher price you potentially pay (in fees) to
get your transactions on a smaller block chain is the price of higher
security and independence. Perhaps the compromise is not at the optimal
place, but please stop saying "below what the technology can do". The
technology can "do" gigabyte blocks I'm sure, If you accept that you need a
small cluster to keep up with validation, and all blocks are produced by a
single miner cartel.

IMHO, Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) on-chain as a payment system is:
* Expensive: there is a (known in advance and agreed upon) inflation that
we're using to pay miners. But by holding Bitcoin you're paying for the
security of the system, even if it is not in fees.
* Unreliable: you never know when suddenly there will be more higher-fee
transactions that outbid you.
* Slow, unless you already trust the sender to not double spend (in which
case you don't actually need the security of the blockchain).

I don't know the future, and I don't know what use cases will develop and
what they'll want to pay or what reliability they need. But let's please
not throw out the one quality that Bitcoin is still good at: lack of
centralized parties to trust.

> So if they dont care about decentralisation, they'll be happy using cheaper
off-chain systems, right?

You betcha! Just talk to a regular people and try to sell them on the
different scenarios.

They will start using something cheaper/faster the minute it comes along
from the banking industry, just to give you a real world example, this week
I've been dreading the idea of having to go to the bank to make a couple of
cash deposits. If I could open my bank's web page right now and do a very
simple interbank transaction (without having to convince the to let me link
their accounts to mine, with the process that takes like 2 days when they
deposit 2 different cent amounts...) just here within the retarded US
banking system... which has clearly realized the threat from
cryptocurrencies as evidenced on many banker conferences this year.

They will come up with ways to allow us to do person to person transfers,
but this will surely be limited to transactions within the country,
international remittances still have a great chance of being disrupted by
Bitcoin, if and only if, it will be cheap, otherwise the western unions and
xooms of the world will still rule.

Please get out of our your academic cocoon for a bit, talk to real people,
try to convince them to use Bitcoin, and think how hard it will be to make
the sell if on top you tell them... "it costs more... but it's
decentralized!" LOL

I think the case for increasing block size can be made without appealing to
fear of unknown effects of a fee market developing. I agree with you that
the most likely outcome is that fees will rise to a new equilibrium as
competition for block space increases, and some use cases will get priced
out of the market. If fees rise high enough, the effects of this can be
pretty bad though. I get the sense that you don't think high fees are that
bad / low fees are that good.

Can you let me know which of these statements related to low fees you
disagree with?

(0) Bitcoin's security will eventually have to be paid for almost entirely
via txn fees.

(1) A future in which lots of users are making on chain txns and each
paying 5 cents/tx is more sustainable than one in which a smaller number of
users are paying $3/tx, all else being equal (pretend the centralization
pressures are very low in both instances, and each scenario results in the
same amount of total tx fees).

(2) It's important that Bitcoin become widely used to protect the network
against regulators (note how political pressure from users who like Uber
have had a huge effect on preventing Uber from being banned in many
locations).

(3) There are potentially a lot of valuable use cases that can benefit from
Bitcoin's decentralization which can work at 5 cents / tx but are nonviable
at $3 / tx. Allowing fees to stay at $3 / tx and pricing out all the viable
use cases between $3 and 5 cents / tx would likely result in a significant
loss of utility for people who want these use cases to work.

(4) The Lightning Network will be a lot less appealing at $3 / tx than 5
cents / tx, because it'll require much larger anchor txn values to
sufficiently amortize the costs of the Bitcoin tx fees, and having to pay
$3 each time your counter-party misbehaves is somewhat painful.

(5) Assuming that Bitcoin is somewhat likely to end up in the "lots of
users, lower fees" situation described in (1), it's important that people
can experiment with low fee use cases now so that these use cases have time
to be discovered, be improved, and become popular before Bitcoin's security
relies exclusively on fees.


Finally, here's a type of question that devs on this list really don't like
answering but which I think is more informative than almost any other: If
you knew that hard forking to 4 MB soon would keep fees around 5 cents
(with a fee market) for the next two years, and that remaining at 1 MB
would result in fees of around $1 for the next two years, would you be in
favor of the 4 MB hard fork? (I know our knowledge of the decentralization
risks isn't very complete now, but assume you had to make a decision given
the state of your knowledge now).

Bitcoin (as well as the internet, and the world wide web) is already
regulated around the world.
There used to be a map that documented this fairly well, called
bitlegal (bitlegal.net) but the site is now parked or offline.  There
is an alternative visual picture of the subject at:
http://is.gd/vFgYrf
The upshot of that is that web wallets (which are popularized due to
convenience) cannot be considered to provide users with control over
their money - extended discussion on this here in the bitcoin.org
repository:
https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/issues/996

My question, therefore is this:
When you say "it will be pressured into regulation, eventually," what
do you mean? Are you implying that even the hardware wallets and
desktop wallets for bitcoin will be regulated to the point where they
cannot be used by individuals who actually care about being able to
circumvent financial censorship?  If so, explain how that is the case.

 I could see an argument where that might be the case to some degree
if you would mention it in the context of services like Chainalysis
and other companies that are in the process of setting up services for
corporation-states for "virtual currency compliance;" e.g.; if
activity can be scanned and if a state has a requirement you are
supposed to be registered with the state to use virtual currency at
some level, and if companies scan the blockchain and report this
information to states (as they now do), then as you say, the only
reasonable method of using virtual currencies would be one in which
location is masked and information about the nodes and history of
transactions can be hidden.  However, this requires more privacy and
anonymity effort in bitcoin development, but I don't think it would
actually keep people from using hardware and desktop wallets (although
I do think eventually people will, as they are beginning to now, be
gradually censored more and more from utilizing web wallets for
activities that they desire).

It seems to me that the existence of various tools and conditions
(external to the whole issue of legal constraints) are also very
important.  For example, various companies have recently made public
announcements that they will leave (or not operate in) New York due to
Bitlicense - Kraken, Shapeshift.io, poloniex, and others.  It's
understandable given the extreme nature of NY's approach (I personally
oppose any regulation of virtual currencies).  But technically, they
didn't have to cease operating, did they?  This was a failure in their
business model.  They made a big statement about how evil NY was and
fled the scene, perhaps never to return to serve NY.  (Note, I don't
live in NY, so I'm not personally being left out in the cold when
Kraken etc. leave, for the record.) As said, this was a failure in
Kraken, poloniex's, shapeshift's, etc., business model.  Why?  Because
here we are talking about web-based services.  A distributed,
decentralized, peer-to-peer model in which the user has a piece of
software on their computer (think openbazaar or bitsquare) is far and
away better than services which are web based.  Why?  Because systems
which are set up such as (openbazaar, bitsquare) don't have to worry
about the constraints of state boundaries or shifting legal things,
nor do the people who made the software end up holding keys on behalf
of the users.  If Kraken, poloniex, etc., had bothered to develop
contingency software (similar to what is being worked on with
https://bitsquare.io/ for example) for users who might be affected in
jurisdictions where corporation-states Just Don't Get It (read... NY,
and possibly CA, as examples) then maybe they wouldn't have to worry
about it at all.  It just would be a matter of users installing a
piece of software from their website, discontinuing the web-based
exchange for that state, and directing users for highly regulated
states to a download page for the decentralized exchange software.
Not that hard really - but something we haven't seen done yet by the
big exchanges.

I have another question for you below...

Why do you say 8GB / block would destroy the very nature of Bitcoin?
I don't see that it would destroy bitcoin... but also, what would
cause 8GB to happen very soon?  As I understood it, any process would
phase increases.  Explain how that would destroy the very nature of
Bitcoin?

Blocksize is extremely likely to get bigger (I'm supposing here that
some version of Garzik's BIP 100 or something very close to it is what
will likely be adopted and that the blocksize would be voted on
something like this:
https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/37943/bip-100-what-votes-are
- -possible

Am I wrong?  Please let me know if I'm dumb.

I am aware consensus isn't precisely there yet, but I'm just curious.

This seems to be a really good idea... May I add in here something
that's been dismissed before but I will mention it again anyway...

http://is.gd/DiFuRr "dynamic block size adjustment"
My sense has been that something like this could be coupled with
Garzik's BIP 100.  For some reason I keep getting attacked for saying
this.

That rules out Lightning Network.

Lightning relies on third parties all over the place.  Many things must 
be done right, and on-time by N intermediate third parties (subject to 
business pressures and regulation) or your payment will not work.

Lightning hubs can't steal your money.  Yay!  But banks stealing your 
payment money is not a problem with today's payment systems. Some real 
problems with those systems are:

  - Limited ACCESS to payment systems
  - High FEES
  - Transaction AMOUNT restrictions
  - FRAUD due to weak technology
  - CURRENCY conversions

Plain old bitcoin solves all of these problems.

Bitcoin does have challenges.  THROUGHPUT and TIME-TO-RELIABILITY are 
critical ones.  DECENTRALIZATION and PRIVACY must not be degraded.  
These challenges can be met and exceeded.

Hi Michael,

What you seem to be missing is *why* bitcoin is better money. Have you
considered why is it comparatively inexpensive to transact in a medium
that is based on such a highly inefficient technology?

You might want to consider that these two considerations are not
independent. The reduced cost of transacting (and carrying) Bitcoin is a
direct consequence of its trustless nature. Any compromise in that
nature will eliminate that advantage, and therefore Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is designed to solve only one problem that other systems do not.
To accomplish this it makes significant compromises in other areas. The
benefit of this solution is that it cannot be effectively controlled by
the state. As a result, all of the associated overhead is eliminated.
Hence the net cost benefit despite high technical costs.

So this is a case where you should be careful what you wish for.

I agree on the importance of having the credible threat of being able to
operate in the underground, and for the reasons you outlined.  However, I
see that threat as being inherent in the now-public-knowledge that a system
like Bitcoin can exist.  The smart governments already know that
Bitcoin-like systems are unstoppable phenomena, that they can operate over
Tor and I2P, that they can and do run without central servers, and that
they can be run on commodity hardware without detection.  Bitcoin itself
does not need to constantly operate in survival-mode, hunkered down, and
always ready for big brother?s onslaught, to benefit from the protection of
the ?credible threat?.

It?s important to accurately asses the level of threat the Bitcoin system
faces from regulation, legislation, and government ?operations?.  If we are
too paranoid, we are going to waste resources or forgo opportunities in the
name of, essentially, baseless fear.  When I got involved with this project
in 2012, no one really knew how governments were going to react.  Had an
all out war-on-Bitcoin been declared, I think it?s pretty safe to say the
structure of the network would look different than it does today.  We would
probably be discussing ways to disguise Bitcoin traffic to look like VoIP
calls, not talking about how to best scale the network.  In light of the
current regulatory climate surrounding Bitcoin, I believe the best security
against a state-sponsored / political crackdown to be gained at this time
comes from growing the user base and use cases, as opposed to hardening and
fortifying the protocol.  Uber is a great example of this form of
security-though-adoption, as was mentioned earlier today on this mailing
list.

If there are security or network-hardening measures that don?t come at the
expense of growing the user base and use cases, then there is no reason not
to adopt them.  The recent improvements in Tor routing are a great example
of a security improvement that in no meaningful way slows Bitcoin?s
potential growth.  How does this relate to the Blocksize debate?  Let?s
accept that 8 MB blocks might cause a little bit, and perhaps even a
?medium bit? (however that is measured), of centralization.  Although the
network might be slightly more vulnerable to government attack, if millions
more people are able to join the system as a result, I?d wager the overall
security situation would be stronger, owning to greatly decreased risk of
attack.

It depends on which use case's reliability that you focus on. For any
specific use case of Bitcoin, that use case will be more reliable with a
larger block size (ignoring centralization effects).

The effect that I think you're talking about is that with lower fees, some
use cases will exist that otherwise wouldn't have been possible with higher
fees / smaller blocks, and these "low fee only" use cases will not be as
reliable as the use cases you'd see with high fees. But that puts you in a
position or arguing that it's better that low fee use cases never exist at
all, than existing at some high risk of being priced out eventually. Do we
know with high confidence how high tx fees will be in the future? Should it
be up to us discourage low fee use cases from being tried, because we think
the risk that they'll later be priced out is too great? Shouldn't we let
the people developing those use cases make that call? Maybe they don't mind
the unreliability. Maybe it's worth it to them if their use case only lasts
for a few months.

The important point to note is that the reliability of a use case is
determined by the fees that people are willing to pay for that use case,
not the fees that are actually paid. If big banks are willing to pay $1 /
tx for some use case right now, but they only need 200 of these txns per
block, then they might be paying only 5 cents / tx because no one is
forcing them to pay more. The fact that they're only paying 5 cents / tx
now doesn't make them any more vulnerable to new use cases than if they
were paying $1 / tx now. If a new use case started bidding up tx fees, the
banks would just increase their tx fees as high as they needed to (up to
$1).

The reason that larger block sizes increase reliability for any given use
case is that (a) You will never be priced out of blocks by a use case that
is only willing to pay lower fees than you. This is true regardless of the
block size. At worst they'll just force you to pay more in fees and lose
some of your consumer surplus. (b) If a use case is willing to pay higher
fees than you, then they're basically stepping ahead of you in line for
block space and pushing you closer to the edge of not being included in
blocks. The more space that exists between your use case and the marginal
use cases that are just barely getting included in blocks, the less
vulnerable you are to getting pushed out of blocks by new use cases.

If this is tricky to understand, here's an example that will make it clear:

Assume blocks can hold 2000 txns per MB. Before the new use case is
discovered, demand looks like this:

500 txns will pay $1 fees
1000 txns will pay 50 cent fees
2000 txns will pay 5 cent fees
8000 txns will pay 2 cent fees
15,000 txns will pay 1 cent fees.
100,000 txns will pay 0.01 cent fees.

So at a block size of 1MB, fees are 5 cents and user surplus is $925 per
block ($0.95 * 500 + 0.45 * 1000).
At a block size of 8 MB, fees are 1 cent and user surplus is $1,145 per
block ($0.99 * 500 + 0.49 * 1000 + $0.04 * 2000 + $0.01 * 8000).

Now a new use case comes into play and this is added to demand:

3000 txns will pay $5 / tx

That demand changes the scenarios like such:

At 1 MB fees jump to $5, user surplus is $0, and the $925 of value the
previous users were getting is lost. All existing use cases are priced out,
because there wasn't enough room in the blocks to accommodate them plus
this new use case.

At 8 MB, fees would stay at 1 cent, user surplus would be $16,115, and $0
in value would be lost (3000 users who were paying 1 cent for txns that
they valued only at 1 cent would stop making txns). All use cases
corresponding to the txns that were willing to pay at least 2 cents are
still viable, because there was enough space in blocks to accommodate them
plus the 3000 new high fee txns.

Let's say you're running the service that represents the 2000 txns willing
to pay 5 cents each on the demand curve specified above. Let's say you're
worried about being priced out of blocks. Which situation do you want to be
in, the one with 1 MB blocks or 8 MB blocks? It's pretty clear that your
best chance to remain viable is with larger blocks.

I read through your message and see the point you're trying to make,
but would like to point out that it is not useful to talk about
hypothetical scenarios involving Bitcoin that include the supposition
"ignoring centralization effects".

Decentralization concerns are fundamental to this innovation, else it
loses its meaning and value. And that's the trade-off that Pieter,
Jorge, Martin, Adam and others have referring to during the past 24
hours: in order to have a secure Bitcoin that is not vulnerable to
centralization, certain sacrifices have to be made and the Consensus
Rule of a relatively small blocksize is the main protection we
currently have.

There are a lot of "larger blocks, more transactions" arguments being
made that overlook this core axiom of decentralization. That is why
the developers and thinkers with the deepest understanding of this
protocol are pointing out the need for another layer on top of
Bitcoin. That is where the scaling can take place to cater for the
use-cases of more txns, quicker txns, remittance, etc. and with it
increased adoption.

Your concern for adoption is valid yet there are a few assumptions in
your discussion and they are a common thread in the current wave of
"bigger blocksize" topics.

1) Supplying bigger blocks will meet the demand of more people:

Anyone can transact via Bitcoin. By increasing blocksize and making
more transactions possible at low fees, what's to stop a large
corporation, bank or government from using the protocol as a cheap
settlement mechanism. They don't have to fund or develop their own
(well, Ecuador has, for this exact use-case) and perhaps the utility
and capacity of the Bitcoin network means reliability and low fees
(cheaper than a bank clearance, say) for their use-case. In the
process they hog xMB of space in each block and discussion about a
capacity limit continues in this list. Increased supply *will* be
utilized - by all kinds of entities - not only the girl next-door and
the unbanked proletariat.

2) Dissatisfied users will move to alt-coins so Bitcoin better be
careful...

The assumption here is that the best skills and most able minds are
fairly evenly distributed amongst alt-coin dev teams. I doubt this is
true and the notion underestimates the quality of developer that is
attracted to Bitcoin Core to apply themselves to this project, often
self-funded. There are few (if any) comparable cryptocurrencies or cc
dev teams out there. Hence the Bitcoin market cap, the large
stakeholder industry, and the established brand.

3) Bitcoin is better money.

Yes, indeed. It's genius and revolution. Yet, it does not fit every
use-case. I know people don't like it when I make this example, but
it's the truth where I live, and by extension, in many places in the
world:

I live in rural Southeast Asia. Some houses have electricity and some
don't: by choice, because rural lifestyle in the tropics does not
always require you to have electricity. People charge their mobile
phones at the community eating house every other day. The electricity
supply is unreliable. I've had to rig a solar charging system to a
UPS, but most people around here have no choice but to deal with
intermittent power cuts. The local market has a diesel generator, so
constant electricity, but if a power cut lasts for long enough the
local cellular mast battery backup depletes and then there is no
cellular connectivity - the only means of accessing the internet.

Now, how does one expect this community to use or adopt
cryptocurrency? They are mostly unbanked, get paid fiat wages at the
end of the week and spend fiat on commodities, rent, food and
entertainment like the rest of the world. But Bitcoin is not a "better
money" in their case, and who knows for how long this condition will
remain true.

4) TBD

The notion that there be dragons at the capacity limit is unfounded
and reactionary. We have to make the journey and find out what is, in
fact, there at the edge - as many others have argued in the list. This
is our opportunity to make scientific observation and discovery for
the benefit of Bitcoin - while it is still in its early years and the
capacity limit untested.

Who knows? The outcome may be an informed decision to implement bigger
blocks. Informed. Based not on fear and uncertainty but on empirical
observation and facts.

Fees rising due to scarcity has nothing to do with the problem. Its a 
consequence that is irrelevant to me.

Bad situations are roughly divided into two parts;
 * technical
 * marketing.

The technical part is that we already know of several technical 
solutions we 
will need when we have a forever growing backlog. Without them, nodes 
will 
crash.
On top of that, we can expect a lot of new problems we don't know yet.

IT experts are serious when they say that they avoid maxing out a 
system like 
the plague.


Marketing wise full blocks means we can only serve 3 transactions a 
second. 
Which is beyond trivial. All the banks, nasdaq, countries, businesses 
etc etc 
now contemplating using Bitcoin itself will see this as a risk too big to 
ignore and the 1Mb Bitcoin will loose 99% of its perceived value.

If you want fees to rise, then it should be viable to be used, withing 6 
months, for something bigger than the economic size of Iceland. 
(=random 
smallest country I know).

Since you replied to me;

I have to admit I find that a little depressing.
I put forward about 10 reasons in the last 24 hours and all you remember is 
something with fees.  Which, thats the funny part, I never wrote as being a 
problem directly.

I would really like to avoid putting blame. I'd like to avoid the FUD 
accusation and calling people paranoid, even yourself, sounds rather bad 
too...

Personally I think its a bad idea to do write the way you do, which is that 
some people have to prove that bad things will happen if we don't make a 
certain change. It polarizes the discussion and puts people into camps. People 
have to choose sides.

I've been reading the blocksize debate for months now and have been 
wondering 
why people here are either for or against, it makes no sense to me.
Neither camp is right, and everyone knows this!
Everyone knows that bigger blocks doesn't solve the scalability problem. 
Everyone knows that you can't get substantial growth using lightning or higher 
fees in, say, the next 12 months.

Thats one usage of the form unreliable.
Yes, if people start getting their transactions thrown out because of full 
blocks or full memory pools, then its unreliable to send stuff.

Much more importantly is the software is unreliable at such loads. Bitcoin 
core will continue to grow in memory consumption, and eventually crash. Or, 
worse, crash the system its running on.
We know of some issues in the software with regards to running at > 100% 
capacity, I'm sure we'll find more when it actually happens.

IT experts are serious when they say that they avoid maxing out a system like 
the plague.

This, btw, is a good scenario where more centralization ends up happening when 
blocks are always full and people need to upgrade their client every week to 
keep up with the bugfixes.

It's not that I don't remember, it's that for all your "reasons" I can
always say one of these:

1) This could only be an indirect consequence of rising fees (people will
move to a competitive system, cheap transactions will become unreliable,
etc).
2) This problem will appear with other sizes too and it needs to be solved
permanently no matter what (dumb mempool design, true scalability, etc)

Whatever, even suggesting you may want to just spread fud and that's why
you don't respond directly to the questions made you respond directly to
the question: you answered with "[]".
I just give up trying that people worried about a non-increase in the short
term answer to me that question. I will internally think that they just
want to spread fud, but not vey vocal about it.
It's just seems strange to me that you don't want to prove to me that's not
the case when it is so easy to do so: just answer the d@#/&m question.

> Everyone knows that bigger blocks doesn't solve the scalability problem.

I'm not so sure, people keep talking about the need to scale the system by
increasing the consensus maximum...
But I'm happy that, indeed, many (possibly most?) people understand this.

> Everyone knows that you can't get substantial growth using lightning or

I disagree with this.
In any case, how can future demand be easier to predict than software
development times?

Don't fear this happening at 1 MB, fear this happening at any size. This
needs to be solved regardless of the block size.
Don't worry, the "doing nothing side" is already taking care of this. I
will give the link for the second time...

No, please don't just say "whatever". Show some respect, please.

If you have the courage to say people are spreading FUD you really should 
have already exhausted all possible avenues of cooperation.
Now you look like you give up and blame others.

Again, I've been trying really hard to give you answers, straight answers.
It saddens me if you really are giving up trying to understand what people 
equally enthusiastic about this technology may see that you don't see.

In the evolution of Bitcoin over the next couple of years we need bigger 
blocks for a lot of different reasons. One of them is that LN isn't here.
The other is that we have known bugs that we have to fix, and that will take 
time. Time we are running out of.
To buy more time, get bigger blocks now.

Anyway, I dislike your approach, as I said in the previous mail.
Its not about people spreading FUD or sidestepping the question, it is about 
keeping the discussion civilised.  You are essentially the one that asks;
 "if you are not beating your wife, please prove it to me".
And the you get upset when I try to steer the conversation into less 
black/white situations...
And, yes, that analogy is apt because you can't prove either.

I know, everyone knows.

There is a lot of work that needs to be done to be able to use bitcoind at an 
forever growing backlog. And since I've been doing software for some decades, 
I can tell you this won't be done or fixed in 6-12 months.
We probably haven't found the majority of the issues yet.

We need more time and a bigger blocksize gives us more time.

I feel people aren't being respectful with me either, but what I feel
doesn't matter.
I really feel I am very close to exhaust all possible avenues for that
question getting directly answered.
Suggesting that the answer doesn't come because the goal it's just to
spread FUD was one of my last hopes. And it didn't work!

This question had been dodged repeatedly (one more time in this last response).
I could list all the times I have repeated the question in various
forms in the last 2 weeks and the "answers" I received (when I
received any answer at all) but I'm afraid that will take too much
time.
Then we could go one by one and classify them as:

1) Potential indirect consequence of rising fees.
2) Software problem independent of a concrete block size that needs to
be solved anyway, often specific to Bitcoin Core (ie other
implementations, say libbitcoin may not necessarily share these
problems).

If you think there's more "problem groups", please let me know.
Otherwise I don't see the point in repeating the question. I have not
received a straight answer but you think you've given it.
Seems like a dead end.

I don't think everybody knows, but thank you for saying this
explicitly! Now I know for sure that you do.
Now I know that you are ok with classifying this concern under group 2
in my above list.

I believe all concerns I've read can be classified in the following groups:

- Lowest fee transactions (currently free transactions) will become
more unreliable.
- People will migrate to competing systems (PoW altcoins) with lower fees.

- Bitcoin Core's mempool is unbounded in size and can make the program
crash by using too much memory.
- There's no good way to increase the fee of a transaction that is
taking too long to be mined without the "double spending" transaction
with the higher fee being blocked by most nodes which follow Bitcoin
Core's default policy for conflicting spends replacements (aka "first
seen" replacement policy).

I have started with the 3 concerns that I read more often, but please
suggest more concerns for these categories and suggest other
categories if you think there's more.

Message-ID: <CABm2gDqn4bDTqmp=9h_qBjgjV0=LhY97bTHdRevAREYVyR07EQ@mail.gmail.com>

We've identified a fundamental disagreement in:

- The block size maximum consensus rule serves to limit mining centralization

But as said I believe at least 2 different formal proofs can be
produced that in fact this is the case. One of them (the one I'm
working on) remains true even after superluminal communication, free
unlimited global bandwidth and science fiction snarks.
But let's just list the concerns first.

I believe there's 2 categories:

1) Increasing the block size may increase centralization.

- Mining centralization will get worse (for example, China's aggregate
hashrate becomes even larger)
   - Government control in a single jurisdiction could enforce
transaction censorship and destroy irreversibility of transactions
      - Some use cases that rely on a decentralized chain (like
trustless options) cannot rely on Bitcoin anymore.
      - Reversible transactions will have proportional fees rather
than flat ones.
         - Some use cases that rely on flat fees (like remittance) may
not be practical in Bitcoin anymore
- The full node count will decrease, leaving less resources to serve SPV nodes.

2) Trying to avoid "hitting the limit" permanently minimizes minimum
fees (currently zero) and fees in general

- If fees' block reward doesn't increase enough, the subsidy block
reward may become insufficient to protect the irreversibility of the
system at some point in time, and the system is attacked and destroyed
at that point in time
- Miners will continue to run noncompetitive block creation policies
(ie accepting free transactions)
- More new Bitcoin businesses may be created based on unsustainable
assumptions and consequently fail.
- "Free transactions bitcoin marketing" may continue and users may get
angry when they discover they have been lied about the sustainability
of that property and the reliability of free transactions.

Please suggest more concerns or new categories if you think they're needed.

Hash: SHA1

Jorge, you say 3 concerns at the end of your message but I only see 1)
and 2). Assuming you've got a 3) and will add it, I'll contribute:

4) General, undefined fear that something bad is going to happen when
nodes choke up on a backlog of transactions.
- - no specific symptoms are pointed at but presumably there is
"pre-traumatic stress" at play.
- - Bitcoin-based businesses are going to lose money, customers and
potentially fail
- - people will flee Bitcoin for another cryptocoin and Bitcoin will be
left in the corner, collecting dust and memories of it will fade as
SuperCoin with its big blocks becomes all things to all people.

5) Specific belief that the exchange rate will decline on network
unreliability
- - traders and investors will bid the price down, or
- - traders/investors will stop speculating all together because even if
their speculation is successful, they're not sure they'll be able to
get their bitcoin out of exchanges, what with the broken network and all.
- - The exchange rate reflects Bitcoin's value and not just speculation
guided by a few large players like in other markets.

6) Belief that Bitcoin's "cargo" is about to be delivered by fate:
- - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult
- - the cargo is variably presumed to be a range of hoped-for events: an
adoption surge, a speculative rally similar to (or bigger than) 2013,
or a global financial crisis that sees Bitcoin become the safe haven
of choice.
- - for the cargo to be delivered, a "runway" must be built - the larger
the runway, the larger the cargo delivery. If the current runway is
not expanded, then the cargo plane will go to a different island and
won't come to Bitcoin Island.
- - it is short-sighted and, in a way, ungrateful of the "generals" not
to expand the runway - it will be their fault that the cargo doesn't
get delivered and all the island's people, no the whole ocean's
islands, will suffer because of silly security concerns.
- - some people have taken the blueprints of the airbase and are
building a large airstrip elsewhere on Bitcoin Island, but nobody is
helping them build that long and wide runway. Everybody wants to
expand this moderate runway - even the renegades who started Big
Blocks Great Success airstrip.
- - The sacred site of No-Middle-Zero-Attack-Point is at the start of
the current runway. To expand it the site must be destroyed, but some
former generals and many people say: It doesn't matter, we want Cargo,
not a small attack surface. Just blast it!

I have not made any arguments that fall within this section.

I'd like to suggest that number two is not described narrowly enough. This 
includes everything that we need, ever will need and want in the future...

2) Testing and architectural improvements related to nodes that get more 
transactions than can be handled for a considerable time.

This includes problems we don't know of yet, since we haven't run under 
these conditions before.

I quoted one such answer above, would be interested in knowing how you 
missed it.
Here is another one from 2 hours before that email;
 "All the banks, nasdaq, countries, businesses etc etc
 "now contemplating using Bitcoin itself will see this as a risk too big to
 "ignore and the 1Mb Bitcoin will loose 99% of its perceived value."

After repeating some answers you said were missing, it would be nice to 
know where the connection drops.

Maybe you don't understand what people answer, if so, please ask to explain 
instead of saying people are dodging the question.  ;)

To that I have this reply;
http://www.aleanjourney.com/2009/07/stop-fighting-fires.html


Your question makes sure that the proper answers don't fit.
And that may be why you are getting frustrated because I've given a lot of 
reasons why a blocksize increase is needed soon, and none of them show up 
in your list...

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010120.html

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010129.html

And various others; I'm not going to bother pasting URLs, you probably have 
them already.

Point is, Bitcoin is a growing network, with a growing amount of transactions 
and we KNOW we will get into problems when the block consistently get full. 
How do we know? Because of the old guys in this list having the experience 
that this always happens, because anyone in the IT business can tell you the 
same.

We have started LN to cope with this growth, but this won't be enough since it 
just won't handle all usecases and thus the on-chain growth will continue. For 
instance remittances and cross-border purchases.
We need both LN as well as bigger blocks.

Many miners are already voting on BIP 100 -- see the blocks published.

The BIP itself should be submitted w/ implementation in the next 2 weeks.

A set of goals is needed and then you develop road maps.  At that point 
you can propose specific changes that fit within a road map.

I'd rephrase this as "Consequences of high fees." It's the level of fees
that is the main issue, not their movement. Moving from 0 satoshi to 1
satoshi fees makes no real difference. Moving from $0 to $1 fees makes a
huge difference. Some consequences are indirect, but others are not (the
first three below are not indirect). Some of the consequences are
uncertain, but others we can have very high confidence in (again: the first
three) and it's only their effect size that can be reasonably disputed.

Here are lots of reasons that you're missing. High fees do the following:

-Reduce the utility of people using the network, even if the higher fees
don't reduce their amount of transactions.
-Make some use cases nonviable, depriving people of Bitcoin's decentralized
benefits.
-Makes level 2 infrastructure like Lightning less valuable by increasing
the minimum value of anchor txns that make sense, and increasing the amount
of pain suffered when your counterparty misbehaves.
-Discourage experimentation with new Bitcoin use cases, making it more
unlikely that such cases are discovered/improved/popular before Bitcoin's
security relies on having many users.
-Makes Bitcoin more vulnerable to regulation by keeping its user base from
growing, meaning regulators face less pressure to keep it unregulated (see:
Uber)
-Reduce the amount of time we have between now and when tx fees need to pay
for a significant portion of Bitcoin's security, by keeping the exchange
rate and thus the value of block rewards low (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange)
-By slowing usage growth, make it less likely that we have a large enough
base of transactions by the time we need to fund network security via tx
fees.

A concern I have is about security (hash rate) as a function of block size.

I am assuming that hash rate is correlated with revenue from mining.

Total revenue from fees as a function of block size should be a curve.  On
one extreme of the curve, if blocks are too big, fee revenue tends towards
0 as there is no competition for block space.  At the other extreme, if
blocks are too small, fee revenue is limited only to what the most valuable
use case(s) can afford.  Somewhere in the middle there should be a sweet
spot where fee revenue is maximised.  It's not a static curve though, it
should change as demand for block space changes.

Failing to scale the block size as demand grows might be forfeiting
potential miner revenue and hence security.

(I don't think that should be a primary concern though since
decentralisation should come first, but I'm just pointing it out as a
secondary concern).

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP-draft] CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY - An opcode for
	relative locktime
Message-ID: <CADJgMztgE_GkbrsP7zCEHNPA3P6T=aSFfhkcN-q=gVhWP0vKXg@mail.gmail.com>

I have written the following draft BIP for a new opcode
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY by Mark Friedenbach, which introduces a form of
relative-locktime to Bitcoin's scripting language.

https://github.com/btcdrak/bips/blob/bip-checksequenceverify/bip-csv.mediawiki

<pre>
  BIP: XX
  Title: CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
  Authors: BtcDrak <btcdrak at gmail.com>
           Mark Friedenbach <mark at friedenbach.org>
  Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2015-08-10
</pre>

==Abstract==

This BIP describes a new opcode (CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) for the Bitcoin
scripting system that in combination with BIP 68 allows execution
pathways of a script to be restricted based on the age of the output
being spent.


==Summary==

CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY redefines the existing NOP3 opcode. When executed
it compares the top item on the stack to the inverse of the nSequence
field of the transaction input containing the scriptSig. If the
inverse of nSequence is less than the sequence threshold (1 << 31),
the transaction version is greater than or equal to 2, and the top
item on the stack is less than or equal to the inverted nSequence,
script evaluation continues as though a NOP was executed. Otherwise
the script fails immediately.

BIP 68's redefinition of nSequence prevents a non-final transaction
from being selected for inclusion in a block until the corresponding
input has reached the specified age, as measured in block heiht or
block time. By comparing the argument to CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY against
the nSequence field, we indirectly verify a desired minimum age of the
the output being spent; until that relative age has been reached any
script execution pathway including the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY will fail
to validate, causing the transaction not to be selected for inclusion
in a block.


==Motivation==

BIP 68 repurposes the transaction nSequence field meaning by giving
sequence numbers new consensus-enforced semantics as a relative
lock-time. However, there is no way to build Bitcoin scripts to make
decisions based on this field.

By making the nSequence field accessible to script, it becomes
possible to construct code pathways that only become accessible some
minimum time after proof-of-publication. This enables a wide variety
of applications in phased protocols such as escrow, payment channels,
or bidirectional pegs.


==Specification==

Refer to the reference implementation, reproduced below, for the precise
semantics and detailed rationale for those semantics.


    case OP_NOP3:
    {
        if (!(flags & SCRIPT_VERIFY_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY)) {
            // not enabled; treat as a NOP3
            if (flags & SCRIPT_VERIFY_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS) {
                return set_error(serror, SCRIPT_ERR_DISCOURAGE_UPGRADABLE_NOPS);
            }
            break;
        }

        if (stack.size() < 1)
            return set_error(serror, SCRIPT_ERR_INVALID_STACK_OPERATION);

        // Note that unlike CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY we do not need to
        // accept 5-byte bignums since any value greater than or
        // equal to SEQUENCE_THRESHOLD (= 1 << 31) will be rejected
        // anyway. This limitation just happens to coincide with
        // CScriptNum's default 4-byte limit with an explicit sign
        // bit.
        //
        // This means there is a maximum relative lock time of 52
        // years, even though the nSequence field in transactions
        // themselves is uint32_t and could allow a relative lock
        // time of up to 120 years.
        const CScriptNum nInvSequence(stacktop(-1), fRequireMinimal);

        // In the rare event that the argument may be < 0 due to
        // some arithmetic being done first, you can always use
        // 0 MAX CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.
        if (nInvSequence < 0)
            return set_error(serror, SCRIPT_ERR_NEGATIVE_LOCKTIME);

        // Actually compare the specified inverse sequence number
        // with the input.
        if (!CheckSequence(nInvSequence))
            return set_error(serror, SCRIPT_ERR_UNSATISFIED_LOCKTIME);

        break;
    }

    bool CheckSequence(const CScriptNum& nInvSequence) const
    {
        int64_t txToInvSequence;

        // Fail under all circumstances if the transaction's version
        // number is not set high enough to enable enforced sequence
        // number rules.
        if (txTo->nVersion < 2)
            return false;

        // Sequence number must be inverted to convert it into a
        // relative lock-time.
        txToInvSequence = (int64_t)~txTo->vin[nIn].nSequence;

        // Sequence numbers under SEQUENCE_THRESHOLD are not consensus
        // constrained.
        if (txToInvSequence >= SEQUENCE_THRESHOLD)
            return false;

        // There are two types of relative lock-time: lock-by-
        // blockheight and lock-by-blocktime, distinguished by
        // whether txToInvSequence < LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD.
        //
        // We want to compare apples to apples, so fail the script
        // unless the type of lock-time being tested is the same as
        // the lock-time in the transaction input.
        if (!(
            (txToInvSequence <  LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD && nInvSequence <
LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD) ||
            (txToInvSequence >= LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD && nInvSequence >=
LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD)
        ))
            return false;

        // Now that we know we're comparing apples-to-apples, the
        // comparison is a simple numeric one.
        if (nInvSequence > txInvToSequence)
            return false;

        return true;
    }

https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/commit/33be476a60fcc2afbe6be0ca7b93a84209173eb2


==Example: Escrow with Timeout==

An escrow that times out automatically 30 days after being funded can be
established in the following way. Alice, Bob and Escrow create a 2-of-3
address with the following redeemscript.

    IF
        2 <Alice's pubkey> <Bob's pubkey> <Escrow's pubkey> 3
CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY
    ELSE
        <LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD + 30*24*60*60> CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY DROP
        <Alice's pubkey> CHECKSIGVERIFY
    ENDIF

At any time funds can be spent using signatures from any two of Alice,
Bob or the Escrow.

After 30 days Alice can sign alone.

The clock does not start ticking until the payment to the escrow address
confirms.


==Reference Implementation==

A reference implementation is provided in the following git repository:

https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/tree/checksequenceverify


==Deployment==

We reuse the double-threshold switchover mechanism from BIPs 34 and
66, with the same thresholds, but for nVersion = 4. The new rules are
in effect for every block (at height H) with nVersion = 4 and at least
750 out of 1000 blocks preceding it (with heights H-1000..H-1) also
have nVersion = 4. Furthermore, when 950 out of the 1000 blocks
preceding a block do have nVersion = 4, nVersion = 3 blocks become
invalid, and all further blocks enforce the new rules.

It is recommended that this soft-fork deployment trigger include other
related proposals for improving Bitcoin's lock-time capabilities, including:

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki BIP 65]:
OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY,

[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0068.mediawiki BIP 68]:
Consensus-enforced transaction replacement signalled via sequence numbers,

and [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-00XX.mediawiki BIP XX]:
Median-Past-Time-Lock.


==Credits==

Mark Friedenbach invented the application of sequence numbers to
achieve relative lock-time, and wrote the reference implementation of
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.

The reference implementation and this BIP was based heavily on work
done by Peter Todd for the closely related BIP 65.

BtcDrak authored this BIP document.

Would be wonderful to have this pushed together with CLTV and BIP68.
If BIP68 get pushed in the next fork, this CSV is a no brainer.

Was there a competing RCLTV implementation somewhere that did not depend on
BIP68 for information ? I don't manage to find it.

I think all such competing proposals are dropped because this seemed like a better idea. Feel free to revive one/come up with one, though.

This isn?t necessarily true. Every miner has its own mining policy. If they choose to delay including transactions proportional to their fee + first seen, then you create a time based fee market. Want quick confirmation? Pay a high fee. Don?t care that much? Pay a low fee (and anywhere in between). This market would work just fine even if block capacity was unbounded.

I think it's important to allow some time for discussion with the
actual proposed text up; as understandings can shift significantly. :)
Btcdrak already asked me for numbers prior to posting text at all and
I asked him to post text...

3) A few more people begin using bitcoin. Bitcoin buckles and dies.

- Something happens a few months from now causing an influx of new users
and more transactions.
- Blocks are constantly full.
- A backlog of transactions keeps growing indefinitely.
- At first people say "bitcoin is slow". After a while they say "bitcoin
doesn't work".
- Changing the hard limit on block size requires a fork and takes too long.
- As bitcoin no longer works people stop using it.
- Bitcoin lives out the last of its days in the backwaters of the
internet with only 5 users. They keep telling people "we increased the
block size now". Unfortunately noone is listening anymore.
- People laugh at you and say "I told you that buttcoin thing was doomed
to fail. After all it wasn't real money."

If the hard limit had been increased earlier then mining pools would
have been able to react quickly by upping their own soft limit. But this
was not the case and so ended Bitcoin.

So in summary:

By increasing the block size limit you run the risk of:
- The transaction fee market takes a little longer to develop.
By not increasing the limit you run the risk of:
- Bitcoin dies. The end.

Transaction fees should not be the main topic of this discussion, and
probably not even a part of it at all. That seems outright irresponsible
to me.

Very cool! This will certainly help make Lightning Network testable on
the main-chain and permit channels to remain open indefinitely. I'm
looking forward to it.

I haven't tested the details of this, but is there another bit available
for use in the future for the relative blockheight?

I strongly believe that Lightning needs mitigations for a systemic
supervillan attack which attemps to flood the network with transactions,
which can hypothetically be mitigated with something like a timestop
bit (as originally suggested by gmaxwell).

Summary: If a block is flagged as timestopped (whether automatically or
by vote or other mechanism), then an auxillary blockheigh is frozen and
does not increment. This auxillary blockheight is only used for
accounting in timestopped height computation (and isn't used for
anything else). So as the real blockheight increments, the auxillary
blockheight can sometimes stop and stay the same. If a transaction has a
timestop bit enabled, then the transaction's OP_CSV relative height is
dependent upon the auxillary height, not the real block height. This
allows for a large backlog of transactions which must occur before a
particular (relative) block height to enter into the blockchain.

I'm not sure if it's out of scope, but it could make sense to consider
the possibility for additional state(s) with relative height computation
today. Ideally, there'd be some kind of "version" byte which can be
recontextualized into something later, but I don't know how that could
cleanly fit into the data structure/code.

This proposal includes no such provision.

Since we talked about it, I spent considerable time thinking about the
supposed risk and proposed mitigations. I'm frankly not convinced that it
is a risk of high enough credibility to worry about, or if it is that a
protocol-level complication is worth doing.

The scenario as I understand it is a hub turns evil and tries to cheat
every single one of its users out of their bonds. Normally a lightning user
is protected form such behavior because they have time to broadcast their
own transactions spending part or all of the balance as fees. Therefore
because of the threat of mutually assured destruction, the optimal outcome
is to be an honest participant.

But, the argument goes, the hub has many channels with many different
people closing at the same time. So if the hub tries to cheat all of them
at once by DoS'ing the network, it can do so and spend more in fees than
any one participant stands to lose. My issue with this is that users don't
act alone -- users can be assured that other users will react, and all of
them together have enough coins to burn to make the attack unprofitable.
The hub-cheats-many-users case really is the same as the
hub-cheats-one-user case if the users act out their role in unison, which
they don't have to coordinate to do.

Other than that, even if you are still concerned about that  scenario, I'm
not sure timestop is the appropriate solution. A timestop is a
protocol-level complication that is not trivial to implement, indeed I'm
not even sure there is a way to implement it at all -- how do you
differentiate in consensus code a DoS attack from regular old blocks
filling up? And if you could, why add further complication to the consensus
protocol?

A simpler solution to me seems to be outsourcing the response to an attack
to a third party, or otherwise engineering ways for users to
respond-by-default even if their wallet is offline, or otherwise assuring
sufficient coordination in the event of a bad hub.

Geir,

In the scenario below, you argue that the current 1MB limit would lead
to "constantly full" blocks. If the limit is increased to say 1.6GB
then a government or banking group may choose to utilize 1.5GB of the
capacity of each block (and pay fees or not) for their settlement
network. Then how did upping the blocksize remedy anything? Or is this
use-case not plausible?

I would like to ask you, or anyone on the list: when we say that
mining secures the network, what does that mean?

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Adjusted difficulty depending on relative blocksize
Message-ID: <09C8843E-8379-404D-8357-05BDB1F749C1@me.com>

Greetings,

a thought occurred to me that I would love to hear what some bitcoin experts think about.

What if one were to adjust the difficulty (for individual blocks) depending on the relative size to the average block size of the previous difficulty period? (I apologize if i?m not using the correct terms, I?m not a real programmer, and I?ve only recently started to subscribe to the mailing list)


In practice:

1. calculate average block size for the previous difficulty period (is it 2016-blocks?)
2. when trying to find a new block adjust the difficulty by adding the relative size difference. For instance, if i?m trying to create a block half (or double) the size of the average block size for the previous difficulty period then my difficulty will be 2x the normal one? if I?m trying to make one that is 30% bigger (or smaller) then the difficulty is 1.3 times the normal one


Right now this would force miners to make blocks as close to 1mb as possible (since the block reward >> fees). But unless I?m mistaken sometime in the future the block size should be adjusted to maximize the fees?


Could the concept be useful somehow?

I apologize if it?s been discussed before or if it?s a stupid idea, I would have run it by some other people, but I?m afraid I don?t know anyone that have any interest in bitcoin.

Regards

In that case it didn't remedy the problem of constantly full blocks, but
got a ton of people on board the bitcoin train in the meanwhile. And with
them more interest, investments, research and ideas.

In the case we increase the limit and no government or banking group
immediately uses up all the space in blocks, it of course would prevent
constantly full blocks for the time being. Bitcoin keeps working reliably,
is fast and cheap -- more users on board the bitcoin train. And as long as
we do not immediately increase it to 1.6GB (something no one is
suggesting), we could still maintain a good level of decentralization,
maybe even increase it together with an increase in users.

Eventually we'll have to deal with the fading subsidy, but there's no
reason to deal with it at this point in time. What we need today is more
users and artifically limiting the blocksize doesn't help with that. At the
very least we should try to incorporate technological growth into bitcoin.
Keep the 2010 1MB limit, but account for "inflation". If you're arguing
that noone can predict the future development of bandwidth, cpu and storage
I'd say it doesn't matter if we are too optimistic, because when we start
seeing that a future doubling of the limit will cause major issues, it will
be easy to find consensus and change the rule accordingly.

Hmm? well, yes and no. Mostly no :)

The main idea i was trying to describe was that the actual difficulty for the block could be adjusted according to how much the size of the proposed block differ compared to the average size of blocks in the previous difficulty period. Unless I?m being very dense atm your gist is just about dynamically adjusting the blocksize?


 I?ll give a numeric example to clarify a bit.

Assume the current difficulty was calculated to be 1000, and the average size of the blocks in the period used to calculate the difficulty was 500kb.
Example 1:
I?m now attempting to find a new block with a size of 450 kb, or 450/500 = 10% smaller than average. The difficulty would then be 1000 * 110% = 1100
Example 2:
If I instead was trying to make a block sized 10000 kb, or 10000/500 = 2000% bigger than average the difficulty would be adjusted to 1000*20 = 20000


Why I find this interesting is in a possible future when the block reward is insignificant compared to the transactions fees miners would make bigger blocks as fees rise. A miner could include more transactions into blocks as long as the fees are high enough to offset the reduced chance of actually finding the block. However, I now realize that there wouldn?t be any downward pressure below the average size if the price shrinks (using the particular numbers i have in my examples) though. Maybe this method is only useful on the upside of the blocks, meaning blocks smaller than the average size doesn?t get adjusted difficulty. I need to go for a walk and think this through :)

?That would mean that as usage grew, blocksize could increase, but
confirmation times would also increase (though presumably less than
linearly). That seems like a loss?

If you also let the increase in confirmation time (due to miners finding
harder blocks rather than a reduction in hashpower) then get reflected back
as decreased difficulty, it'd probably be simpler to just dynamically
adjust the max blocksize wouldn't it?

Cheers,
aj?

Your usecase only makes sense if we assume that blocks are community property.

This is provably not the case, it has been proven with the recent spam attack, 
people could just continue sending their payments without issues by just 
increasing the fee a bit.

As such, the bigger blocks don't immediately get filled, it makes more space 
for everyone. People abusing it will also have to spend a lot more money (that 
goes to benefit the network as a whole) to disrupt it.

Would that really be the case though? If it takes 5% to find a block, but it contains 5% more transactions would that not mean it?s the same? That would argue against the change if not for the fact that the blocks will be bigger for the next difficulty period.

I guess that could make the difficulty fluctuate a bit depending on the amount of transactions and the fees being paid. Would it really matter in the long run though? Since it?s the same amount of miners, doesn?t that just mean it?s just the number that is lower, not the actual investment needed to mine the blocks? Not sure if this would open up some forms of attacks on the system for someone willing to lose money though?


Very good feedback though, thanks a lot :)

?If you're waiting for one confirmation, something like that works -- you
might from 95% chance of 10 minutes 5% chance of 20 minutes to 100% chance
of 10m30s. But if you want 144 confirmations (eg) you go from 95% chance of
1 day, 5% chance of 1 day 10 minutes; to 100% chance of 1 day 72 minutes.

Once blocksizes had normalised as much larger than 1MB with a corresponding
higher average hashrate, a bad actor could easily mine a raft of valid
empty/small blocks at the minimum hash rate and force a reorg (and do
doublespends, etc).

?Cheers,
aj?

We integrated libconsensus into bits of proof. It works well, in-line for all test cases with our Java engine and is about 50% faster on a single thread.

The performance advantage unfortunatelly reverses if libconsensus is executed on several threads simultaneously as we do with the Java engine, since an error:

	Assertion failed: (pkey != NULL), function CECKey, file ecwrapper.cpp, line 96.

arises under that stress.

I guess that the cause is that thread callbacks as advised for OpenSSL on https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/threads.html are not registered.
Registering those however would require access to OpenSSL functions, not exported from the lib.

I?d be thankful for a pointer to a workaround.

My concern is how the hell do you automate this? Having a threat of
"well, everyone could update their software to a new version which will
destroy all coins right now" is kinda useless, and trying to come up
with a reasonable set of metrics as to how much and when you move from
just paying the fee to destroying coins is really hard, especially if
you assume the attacker is a miner with, say, enough hashrate (maybe
rented) to get one or three blocks in the next day (the timeout period).

Yea, implementation is really tricky here. I do not at all think we
should be thinking about implementing this any time soon, and should
assume Lightning will have to stand reasonably on its own without it
first, and only if it gains a lot of traction will there be enough
motivation for making such a change at the Bitcoin protocol level for
Lightning.

I'm not even sure if sufficient coordination is a sufficient solution.
If you assume a hub just shut down, and everyone is trying to flush to
the chain, with a backlog of a few days worth of transactions (with
timeouts of a day or so), and users are even paying huge fees (99% of
what they'd get back), if the former-hub is a miner, it can claim that
last 1% of many of the transactions that take longer than a day to confirm.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposed new policy for transactions that depend on
	other unconfirmed transactions
Message-ID: <CAPWm=eWuvC8zYM_ipAnaQttKQQG2Vas6np_bAFkxG31eR5w=xQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,


I'd like to propose a new set of requirements as a policy on when to accept
new transactions into the mempool and relay them.  This policy would affect
transactions which have as inputs other transactions which are not yet
confirmed in the blockchain.

The motivation for this policy is 6470
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6470> which aims to limit the size
of a mempool.  As discussed in that pull
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6470#issuecomment-125324736>, once
the mempool is full a new transaction must be able to pay not only for the
transaction it would evict, but any dependent transactions that would be
removed from the mempool as well.  In order to make sure this is always
feasible, I'm proposing 4 new policy limits.

All limits are command line configurable.

The first two limits are required to make sure no chain of transactions
will be too large for the eviction code to handle:

Max number of descendant txs : No transaction shall be accepted if it would
cause another transaction in the mempool to have too many descendant
transactions (all of which would have to be evicted if the ancestor
transaction was evicted).  Default: 1000

Max descendant size : No transaction shall be accepted if it would cause
another transaction in the mempool to have the total size of all its
descendant transactions be too great.  Default : maxmempool / 200  =  2.5MB

The third limit is required to make sure calculating the state required for
sorting and limiting the mempool and enforcing the first 2 limits is
computationally feasible:

Max number of ancestor txs:  No transaction shall be accepted if it has too
many ancestor transactions which are not yet confirmed (ie, in the
mempool). Default: 100

The fourth limit is required to maintain the pre existing policy goal that
all transactions in the mempool should be mineable in the next block.

Max ancestor size: No transaction shall be accepted if the total size of
all its unconfirmed ancestor transactions is too large.  Default: 1MB

(All limits include the transaction itself.)

For reference, these limits would have affected less than 2% of
transactions entering the mempool in April or May of this year.  During the
period of 7/6 through 7/14, while the network was under stress test, as
many as 25% of the transactions would have been affected.

The code to implement the descendant package tracking and new policy limits
can be found in 6557 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6557> which
is built off of 6470.

Thanks,
Alex

Ugh, what an unfortunate oversight!

The good news is that this issue should be solved in future versions
when we switch to the new libsecp256k1 lib for validation.

For now, I've thrown together a quick hack to allow a user-specifiable
callback for libbitcoinconsensus. I think it's not worth messing with
the official API since it will be fixed soon, but rather hacked in as
a temporary work-around as needed. It _should_ be documented as an
issue with the current version, though.

Please see here for a work-around to try:
https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commits/openssl-consensus-threads
Unfortunately it's not pretty, but it works fine here. Note that you
should give this some _serious_ testing before deploying in any real
way. It should mimic the way we do it in Core, though.

That's on top of current master, but it should be trivial to apply to
release tags.

Please let me know how it works out.

Regards,
Cory

With the assumed malleability-fix CHECKSIG2 version of lightning, watching
for and responding to bad behavior is fully outsourceable. You can
synchronize channel state (signed refund transactions) with a third party
that watches for replay of old transactions on the mainnet, and starts the
refund process if it observes them, paying the fees necessary to get on the
chain.

With the CLTV/CSV-only form of the hash time-lock contracts that Rusty has
developed, this is indeed something the users' wallets would have to be
online to observe happening and respond to. I presume that we are
eventually going to get a CHECKSIG2 with some kind of malleability-immune
signing scheme in the long term, and that we are not interested in
introducing new consensus behavior to cover that short stopgap.

> I'm not even sure if sufficient coordination is a sufficient solution.

A regrettable choice of words. In this case it is game theoretic
cooperation, not coordination. The users need only expect that each other
would react the same way, being willing to burn money as fees that would
otherwise be stolen. They don't actually have to communicate with each
other in order to cooperate.

You are correct though that hubs-with-hashpower complicate this situation.
Although a hub with hashpower also creates risk in the timestop scenario
too...

Pieter was arguing for the existence of an effect on reliability that was
orthogonal to centralization risk. When arguing that this effect doesn't
really exist, it's appropriate to hold centralization risk constant.

Yes, concerns or risks. Feel free to bike-shed the word.

I'm not the manager of Bitcoin Core nor the Bitcoin consensus rules.
I'm just trying to separate "dogs from cats" (if you allow me the
analogy) in another random attempt to move the discussion into more
productive territories.
I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't felt we have advance identifying
and understanding each other's concerns better.

This thread is for "guardian dogs". To discuss to mouses catches we're
missing, I've created the other almost-identically-titled thread:
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010188.html
The title of this one doesn't contain a "not" like the other one. You
missed (imagined?) that little detail.

In other words, if you want to contribute to this thread, think about
"things that could go wrong if we rise the consensus block size
maximum".
Judging from your strong conviction about the need of an urgent size
rise, probably you have thought hard about this before concluding that
there's not risk for your favorite proposed size (2MB, 8MB, 8GB,
20GB?).
Note that even if you are certain that those risks aren't a concern at
this scale, identifying and somehow estimating or measuring (if that's
even possible) the risks will be useful for future increases.

Nobody mentioned exchange rates.  Those matter to miners too.

Does it make sense for George Soros and every other rich person /
institution to have the power to move difficulty, even pin it to min or
max, just by buying or selling piles of BTC to swing the exchange rate?

I extremely dislike the inversion to preserve the "previous nSequence
semantics". The "previous nSequence semantics" were
consensus-unenforceable but we can cover the same use cases (or the
realistic ones at least) with nMaturity. Let's face it and move on
without technical debt we don't need and may regret. If we do this
inversion we will likely carry it for very long if not forever.
As a side effect, I believe documentation can become much clearer
(maybe even shorter simultaneusly).

No, sorry it's 2 concerns/risks with 2 sub-concerns/risks each:

1) Potential indirect consequence of rising fees.

1.1) Lowest fee transactions (currently free transactions) will become
more unreliable.
1.2) People will migrate to competing systems (PoW altcoins) with lower fees.

2) Software problem independent of a concrete block size that needs to
be solved anyway, often specific to Bitcoin Core (ie other
implementations, say libbitcoin may not necessarily share these
problems).

2.1) Bitcoin Core's mempool is unbounded in size and can make the program
crash by using too much memory.

2.2) There's no good way to increase the fee of a transaction that is
taking too long to be mined without the "double spending" transaction
with the higher fee being blocked by most nodes which follow Bitcoin
Core's default policy for conflicting spends replacements (aka "first
seen" replacement policy).

I believe thisbelongs in 2, not really sure if 2.1 or 2.2 since it's
related to both.

I believe "fear of exchange rate declining" can probably be added to
any concern/risk "leaf", so we should probably leave that for the end
or just omit it.

I'm not sure I understood this but seems related to the exchange rate.

I think potential is more general since it allows us to list uncertain
consequences (aren't all consequences just projections and thus
uncertain anyway?).

It is a big difference to me (it may mean policy code has improved a
lot in the process).
Anyway, I'm heppy to hear again that this is not a concern, at some
point I thought this was the ONLY concern, so I was clearly
misinterpreting people's arguments.

Let's list them all first and then identify which are more worrying in
the short term.

"Utility" like "value" is always subjective and very vague. I prefer
to identify more concrete ways in which "utility is reduced".

It is clear that not all use cases fit the blockchain, but it's still
unclear which ones don't fit yet.
But the amount of use cases supported is not a valid metric for
decentralization.
In any case, it would be interesting if we could list some concrete
cases that would be lost.

This is correct. Layer 2 can become more expensive in total as well
(it doesn't mean layer 2 doesn't scale though).
I wil add it as 1.3

Experimentation can be done with worthless testchains. I'm not sure
I'm following on this one.

Added:

Resulting list:

1) Potential indirect consequence of rising fees.

1.2) People will migrate to competing systems (PoW altcoins) with lower fees.
1.3) Layer 2 settlements become more expensive

I was tempted to add it as a sub-sub-risk in both, since both things
need to be solved before that stop being a concern. But they may be
more things to do to solve that so I'm listing it as a separate
sub-risk in 2:

2.3) Big list of valid unconfirmed transactions

resulting list:

1) Potential indirect consequence of rising fees.

1.1) Lowest fee transactions (currently free transactions) will become
more unreliable.
1.2) People will migrate to competing systems (PoW altcoins) with lower fees.
1.3) Layer 2 settlements become more expensive
1.4) Less usage than we could have had with a bigger size
1.4.1) More regulation pressure

To be clear, these two are just my personal lists of arguments on
"each side" to clear my mind and try to be perfectly objective.
The resulting lists may not have any practical value but I'm going to
maintain them locally nonetheless. If that's is not useful for the
participants they can just leave the thread.
I'm not going to be impartial: I will only add to my lists the
arguments that I consider reasonable and, more importantly, I
understand.

The lists are in the public domain and everybody is free to use it and
modify it in any way, feel free to fork the threads with other
criteria different from "whatever jtimon thinks is reasonable", but if
you want to participate, face it, it's what these 2 threads are about.

Here's the updated both-thread lists:

Any idea what's going on with TestNet?  No blocks for nearly 2 hours now,
according to multiple block explorers (blockr.io, my own bitcoin node, etc).

Prior to the last block (530516), there were a lot of blocks with zero
transactions and only an occasional block with a ton of txs.

Any info?

Thx,
-Danny

Message-ID: <CA+w+GKT7t5OahS-+P=QAmOyFzPnOs4J6KSo+mhSrC0YggmMupg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

As promised, we have released Bitcoin XT 0.11A which includes the bigger
blocks patch set. You can get it from

     https://bitcoinxt.software/

I feel sad that it's come to this, but there is no other way. The Bitcoin
Core project has drifted so far from the principles myself and many others
feel are important, that a fork is the only way to fix things.

Forking is a natural thing in the open source community, Bitcoin is not the
first and won't be the last project to go through this. Often in forks,
people say there was insufficient communication. So to ensure everything is
crystal clear I've written a blog post and a kind of "manifesto" to
describe why this is happening and how XT plans to be different from Core
(assuming adoption, of course).

The article is here:

    https://medium.com/@octskyward/why-is-bitcoin-forking-d647312d22c1

It makes no attempt to be neutral: this explains things from our point of
view.

The manifesto is on the website.

I say to all developers on this list: if you also feel that Core is no
longer serving the interests of Bitcoin users, come join us. We don't bite.

Fair enough, this is what open source is all about. Good things
sometimes come out of controversial actions. I briefly read the
manifesto, saw the migration plan, it is not that greedy and in theory
it is possible to migrate safely with no (big) incidents.

What seams a little bit unfair is that only miners get to vote and
decide, and the users will have nothing to say about it. Not even
individual miners will vote, since it will be mostly only mining pools
(individual small miners will accept whatever their mining pool runs
on). There are more users than miners obviously, the miners just mine
transactions for the users, it is the users who keep the btc/usd price.

I use bitcoin heavily (not from time to time) but I don't mine - can I
vote? The way I see it I cannot, and I am not saying it is a bad thing,
but I missed the argument explaining why users don't matter and only
miners do.

The btc/usd rate is based on supply and demand, only users take part in
this. If 20% of the miners (hashing power) go away, the network will
still operate normally (lower nethash and probably difficulty) and the
btc/usd price will be the same, but if 20% of the users go away the
btc/usd price will drop -> mining will be less profitable -> miners
could be forced to quit. In other words, the users have more control
over the miners. Why ignore?

Message-ID: <6EC9DDF352DC4838AE9B088AB372428A25E1F42A@DS04>

I have been following the recent block size debates through the mailing list.  I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus.  However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.

The developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth.  When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the "original vision" they claim to honour.

They use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be.  However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.  For example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.

If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project.  Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust.  This present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold.

It is a reasonable question. Let me try and explain why it's done this way.

*In theory*, you do have a vote. If a majority of miners were to club
together and decide to change the protocol against the wishes of the wider
user base, then we'd get a fight between the hashpower majority and the
so-called economic majority. And because bitcoins only have value because
you can buy things with them, in theory, the wishes of the economic
majority should always win.

*In practice*, the code we have today doesn't let us measure what the
economic majority wants. It's not even really clear how that term is
defined. Intuitively we can understand that people who are trading real
goods and services for bitcoin have the final say, because they can always
just refuse to accept BTC. But defining it precisely enough to put in an
algorithm is tricky.

Then you have the question of how to express the vote? For miners, it's
easy: they express their vote by switching to a different full node
implementation that gives them different blocks.

For users, it'd mean switching to a different wallet. If their wallet is
fully validating and the decision is implemented via hard fork, this is
sufficient. If the wallet is *not* fully validating and cannot detect the
fork point by itself, then it'd need help in the form of checkpointing.
Some months ago I pointed out this possibility and a whole bunch of people
freaked out - then bitcoin.org decided to start censoring any wallet that
said it'd ignore what miners wanted.

So if you want a user vote, that's an issue that'd have to be tackled: the
people who admin the main communication channels Bitcoin users have vowed
to censor any program that doesn't slavishly follow 51%+ hash power. That
attempt to control the conversation is certainly not libertarian or
democratic in nature, but there you go.

We can also imagine voting via proof-of-stake. This might be useful as a
form of opinion poll, but wallet developers would have to actually add
support for such a protocol to their apps, and then we're back to the same
issue as with mining pools. Plus, of course, static wealth does not equal
economic importance.

Luckily the wallet market is a decentralisation success story. There are
wallets everywhere these days. Man+dog make their own wallet, it seems. So
it's not silly to think a coin voting protocol could one day happen.

Change 'utility' to 'money.' I'm just saying that paying more money for the
same thing is worse for users. If I'm a user who is used to making txns for
1 cent each and suddenly all my txns cost 1 dollar each. then the benefit I
get for each of my transactions that I still make is reduced by 99 cents
per tx. This is as concrete a negative effect as I can imagine. It might
seem obvious that this is a cost, but it seems to be ignored by a lot of
participants.

Not sure what you mean by "valid metric for decentralization." I thought
the goal here was to list all negative consequences of high fees. Not just
consequences to decentralization. We're trying to figure out how to trade
off risks to decentralization against these other things we're listing
which aren't necessarily about decentralization (such as reduced use cases).

If tx fees rise to $1, then I'll stop making on-blockchain purchases of
less than about $100, meaning pretty much all retail purchases are
eliminated. It's hard to list a lot of use cases that will be lost because
Bitcoin usage is very low right now. I assume most of us believe that there
are lots of interesting use cases that have not developed yet. Just because
they don't exist now doesn't mean we should ignore the fact that high fees
might make them nonviable.

Some examples of stuff that doesn't exist now but might be prevented or
significantly harmed by high fees: small international remittances, machine
to machine payments, decentralized prediction markets (maybe people like
making lots of small bets). Just take any potential use case you can think
of: if the per-tx benefit to the person is less than $1, then $1 tx fees
will prevent it. See below for another example.

I think this is one of the most important costs to worry about. So much of
experimentation can't be done on a testchain, because most experiments that
are being done by early stage companies are about product market fit, and
which services are valuable to users.

Let's say that you and I start a company that allows people to charge money
to people who want to email/message them. There are so many things that we
need to figure out that can't be figured out without participating in the
actual market, with real people, who are really trying to use our service.
It might take us years of making little tweaks to the product before we hit
on some solution that people finally like enough to use in large numbers.

Let's say that right now tx fees are $1, and imagine that the highest
amount that most people are willing to pay to email people is 25 cents. If
we are experimenting in a market with $1 tx fees, perhaps our company will
just die and we'll never figure out how to bring people this service that
they want. Perhaps there are a lot of other innovations relating to 'pay to
message' that would have otherwise been developed (maybe celebrities like
doing AMAs via pay-to-message and devote the funds to charities. Maybe this
becomes a huge source of charitable giving in the future), but because
Bitcoin's high fee environment didn't allow us to explore these ideas, this
whole service category goes undeveloped for many years.

Elsewhere you write "I believe 'fear of exchange rate declining' can
probably be added to any concern/risk 'leaf', so we should probably leave
that for the end or just omit it."

It's true that you could tell some indirect story about how pretty much
anything could affect the exchange rate, but separate from all the
hypothetical stories there is a strong theoretical reason to believe that
the exchange rate will be higher the more value is transacted in the
Bitcoin ecosystem. See the wiki link on the equation of exchange. More
people using Bitcoin for transactions will drive up the price, all else
being equal. Perhaps many people care about the price for irrelevant
reasons (they just want to be rich), but as long as Bitcoin's security is
tied to the exchange rate via block rewards, it's also an important
consideration for security.

These types of actions are immediately apparent to anyone who looks at 
the Bitcoin ecosystem (Bitcoin.org, Githib, Wiki, bitcointalk, etc.) and 
were readily apparent long before any block size debate.  It is almost a 
taboo subject and anyone who raises these types of issues is immediately 
labeled as a "troll."  These are the people who used to run around 
saying that Bitcoin development is "decentralized" because anyone can 
fork the code and now many of the same people claim a fork will destroy 
everything.

The problem is that a small group of highly irrational and inexperienced 
people (outside of the small and unusual Bitcoin ecosystem) have control 
over the majority of the resources.  I think over time the problem will 
even itself out but currently it is an obstacle in moving Bitcoin forward.

You may be misremembering; nobody has ever disagreed that you can fork a
source code repository. Perhaps you are thinking instead about the concerns
regarding "asymmetric" rule incompatibilities?

If this proposal has less than half of the total hashpower (or is it even
less than 75%? Haven't quite thought it through completely) supporting it,
I can see the following happening if the sum of supporters and people who
want to screw the supporters out of money is at least 75%:
Non-supporters create blocks with the new version, but don't actually
implement the rule. Then after the new rule is locked in, miners will
create too-large blocks that are rejected by the majority. If the
percentage is less than half, then from their perspective, they will
essentially be on the losing  side of a soft fork, and they'll be losing
money by mining for nothing, even from their perspective and that of e.g.
users and merchants who have upgraded.

I am not "misremembering" anything.  Some people have claimed for years 
that Bitcoin development is "decentralized" because anyone can fork the 
code.  I have often pointed out to them that such a process is not 
decentralization similar to the process of Bitcoin mining.  It is 
probably closer to checks and balances you see in political systems. The 
response is usually that I am "troll" or that I am somehow attacking the 
developers by simply describing the system.  The result is that the 
issues and risks associated with development are often not properly 
evaluated.  It is the same sorts of problems you have when a central 
bank or Fed is controlled by a small group.  It is just human nature and 
Bitcoin is not immune.

You deeply disappoint me, Mike.

Not only do you misrepresent many cogent, well thought out positions from a great number of people who have published and posted a number of articles detailing an explaining in-depth technical concerns?you also seem to fancy yourself more capable of reading into the intentions of someone who disappeared from the scene years ago, before we even were fully aware of many things we now know that bring the original ?plan? into question.

I ask of you, as a civilized human being, to stop doing this divisive crap. Despite your protestations to the contrary, YOU are the one who is proposing a radical departure from the direction of the project. Also, as several of us have clearly stated before, equating the fork of an open source project with a fork of a cryptoledger is completely bogus - there?s a lot of other people?s money at stake. This isn?t a democracy - consensus is all or nothing. The fact that a good number of the people most intimately familiar with the inner workings of Satoshi?s invention do not believe doing this is a good idea should give you pause.

Please stop using Bitcoin as your own political football?for the sake of Bitcoin?and for your own sake. Despite your obvious technical abilities (and I sincerely do believe you have them) you are discrediting yourself and hurting your own reputation.

What are you so afraid of, Eric? If Mike's fork is successful, consensus is
reached around larger blocks. If it is rejected, the status quo will remain
for now. Network consensus, NOT CORE DEVELOPER CONSENSUS, is the only thing
that matters, and those that go against network consensus will be severely
punished with complete loss of income.

I'm not sure who appointed the core devs some sort of Bitcoin Gods that can
hold up any change that they happen to disagree with. It seems like the
core devs are scared to death that the bitcoin network may change without
their blessing, so they go on and on about how terrible hard forks are.
Hard forks are the only way to keep core devs in check.

Despite significant past technical bitcoin achievements, two of the most
vocal opponents to a reasonable blocksize increase work for a company
(Blockstream) that stands to profit directly from artificially limiting the
blocksize. The whole situation reeks. Because of such a blatant conflict of
interest, the ethical thing to do would be for them to either resign from
Blockstream or immediately withdraw themselves from the blocksize debate.
This is the type of stuff that I hoped would end with Bitcoin, but alas, I
guess human nature never changes.

Personally, I think miners should give Bitcoin XT a serious look. Miners
need to realize that they are in direct competition with the lightning
network and sidechains for fees. Miners, ask yourselves if you think you'll
earn more fees with 1 MB blocks and more off-chain transactions or with 8
MB blocks and more on-chain transactions...

The longer this debate drags on, the more I agree with BIP 100 and Jeff
Garzik because the core devs are already being influenced by outside forces
and should not have complete control of the blocksize. It's also
interesting to note that most of the mining hashpower is already voting for
8MB blocks BIP100 style.

Network consensus, NOT CORE DEVELOPER CONSENSUS, is the only thing that matters, and those that go against network consensus will be severely punished with complete loss of income.

I fully agree that core developers are not the only people who should have a say in this. But again, we?re not talking about merely forking some open source project - we?re talking about forking a ledger representing real assets that real people are holding?and I think it?s fair to say that the risk of permanent ledger forks far outweighs whatever benefits any change in the protocol might bring. And this would be true even if there were unanimous agreement that the change is good (which there clearly IS NOT in this case) but the deployment mechanism could still break things.

If anything we should attempt a hard fork with a less contentious change first, just to test deployability.

It seems like the core devs are scared to death that the bitcoin network may change without their blessing, so they go on and on about how terrible hard forks are. Hard forks are the only way to keep core devs in check.

Again, let?s figure out a hard fork mechanism and test it with a far less contentious change first

This is the type of stuff that I hoped would end with Bitcoin, but alas, I guess human nature never changes.

For the record, I do not work for Blockstream. Neither do a bunch of other people who have published a number of concerns. Very few of the concerns I?ve seen from the technical community seem to be motivated primarily by profit motives.

It should also be pointed out that *not* making drastic changes is the default consensus policy?and the burden of justifying a change falls on those who want to make the change. Again, the risk of permanent ledger forks far outweighs whatever benefits protocol changes might bring.

> Personally, I think miners should give Bitcoin XT a serious look. Miners need to realize that they are in direct competition with the lightning network and sidechains for fees. Miners, ask yourselves if you think you'll earn more fees with 1 MB blocks and more off-chain transactions or with 8 MB blocks and more on-chain transactions?

Miners are NOT in direct competition with the lightning network and sidechains - these claims are patently false. I recommend you take a look at these ideas and understand them a little better before trying to make any such claims. Again, I do not work for Blockstream?and my agenda in this post is not to promote either of these ideas?but with all due respect, I do not think you properly understand them at all.

I don?t think the concern here is so much that some people want to increase block size. It?s the *way* in which this change is being pushed that is deeply problematic.

"I don?t think the concern here is so much that some people want to
increase block size. It?s the *way* in which this change is being pushed
that is deeply problematic."

As a developer on the side lines, bitcoin holder, bitcoin entrepreneur, and
someone who thinks block size limits should be dynamic, I applaud Mike and
Co. for this initiative, some of us that have different ideas on how to
deal with the blocksize issue will certainly not be afraid of wasting time
sending patches to the Bitcoin XT project where it seems they're a bit more
open minded about this issue. I bet sending the same patch to Bitcoin-Core
would be rejected on the spot. Bitcoin XT, I hope, will give room to allow
for scalability, it seems the other camp is bent on using Bitcoin their own
way and their own way only and that's far more problematic because that
will allienate the entire user base eventually.

I know full well who works for Blockstream and I know you're not one of
those folks. The Blockstream core devs are very vocal against a reasonable
blocksize increase (17% growth per year in Pieter's BIP is not what I
consider reasonable because it doesn't come close to keeping with
technological increases). I think we can both agree that more on-chain
space means less demand for lightning, and vice versa, which is a blatant
conflict of interest.

I'm also trying to figure out how things like lightning are not competing
directly with miners for fees. More off-chain transactions means less
blockchain demand, which would lower on-chain fees. I'm not sure what is
controversial about that statement.

The lightning network concept is actually a brilliant way to take fees away
from miners without having to make any investment at all in SSH-256 ASIC
mining hardware.

I posted this to /r/BitcoinMarkets but I thought I might post it here as
well.

---
Currently 0 mined blocks have voted for XT.

If it ever gets close to even 50%, many things can happen that would
reshape the game completely.

For instance:

- Core could start boycotting XT by not relying to them and/or not relying
from them.

- Core could appropriate the version string of XT, making it impossible to
know how much they are progressing and a losing bet to actually execute the
fork.

This kind of node war if the factions were sizeable would make it very
risky to transact at all - balances in new addresses could end up
vanishing. Usability of the system would plummet.

Note that any disagreement between the network and the biggest economic
actors - mainly the exchanges at this point, "wallet services" maybe -
would mean BTC plummets. Hard. And so would confidence.

It's a risky game to play.
---

PS: I consider this attempt at takeover about as foul as it gets. The
equivalent of repeating a referendum until a yes is obtained: the
reasonable reaction to this is actively blocking said "referendum". There
was a fair play alternative which is voting through coinbase scriptSig like
plain 8MBers are doing, or like BIP 100 proposes for dynamic adjustment.
Once a majority is obtained in this way, devs have to react or if they
don't then this sort of foul play would be justified. But this wasn't the
case.

I would like very much to know how it is that we're supposed to be making
money off of lightning, and therefore how it represents a conflict of
interest. Apparently there is tons of money to be made in releasing
open-source protocols! I would hate to miss out on that.

We are working on lightning because Mike of all people said, essentially, "
if you're so fond of micro payment channels, why aren't you working on
them?" And he was right! So we looked around and found the best proposal
and funded it.

Being an early hub provider would be an obvious place to start capitalizing
on lightning. Early lightning adopters would be in the best position to do
this.

Long term, Bitcoin needs to scale the blockchain in a reasonable manner and
implement things like lightning.

Limiting the blocksize is a blatant conflict of interest because it creates
artificial demand for lightning that would not otherwise exist if the
blockchain scaled in a reasonable manner.

Please take the lightning 101 discussion to another thread.

The main point I was trying to make was that Mike is clearly misrepresenting the views of a great number of people who have deep, intimate knowledge of how things work and are almost certainly not primarily motivated by their own potential for profits.

Bitcoin has no elections; it has no courts. If not through attempting a
hard-fork, how should we properly resolve irreconcilable disagreements?

Baseless accusations also have no place on this mailing list. They are
unprofessional, and poisonous to the consensus-building process we all seek
to engage in.

The Lightning Network effort at Blockstream is purposefully structured to
avoid any conflict of interest. ALL code related to lightning is available
on Github. There is absolutely nothing that we are holding back, and the
protocol itself is entirely p2p. There is no privileged entity, Blockstream
or otherwise.

Let's start with the definition of a conflict of interest before we go any
further:
A *conflict of interest* (COI) is a situation in which a person or
organization is involved in multiple interests (financial, emotional, or
otherwise), one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation of the
individual or organization.

Just because a conflict of interest exists does not necessarily mean the
individual with a conflict of interest has engaged in any wrongdoing. They
could be a saint. However, to not even be able to acknowledge that such a
conflict of interest exists when debating such a serious issue as the
bitcoin blocksize is incredibly naive.

I didn't see any baseless accusations in the message.  I saw a 
discussion of possible conflicts of interest.  Your reply seems to 
indicate that somehow conflicts of interest don't exist with the 
developers or that the developers are somehow above everyone else.  The 
fact is the developers on this list discuss conflicts of interest all 
the time as it relates to things like mining.  Conflicts of interest are 
going to be a regular part of Bitcoin development so you should start 
getting used it because it is only going to increase as the value increases.

It is your messages attacking people who raise legitimate issues that is 
poisonous.  It tries to prevent discussions of the risks associated with 
the code development.  It creates an atmosphere where people are 
blackballed if they discuss these issues.  This is what happens in 
religions all the time and it is time to start treating Bitcoin like the 
technology that it is rather than some cult religion.

For all I know is that a hard fork controversy is going to cause the 
price to drop temporarily so for all I know this is a scheme to buy some 
cheap coins just like when hackers used to attack exchanges and 
bitcointalk at the same time to get the price to drop.  (I don't think 
it is a scheme to do that but such a scheme is certainly possible in the 
future and things like that should be expected to happen).

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] How DECOR++ can eradicate selfish mining incentive by
	design
Message-ID: <CAKzdR-rBXMQ22d6F3R23TLTTOALgWsPivyiiwuO-jz1QRLzatw@mail.gmail.com>

In these shocking forking times, nothing more relaxing that to immerse
yourself in a pure technical reading about cryptocurrency design, letting
aside Bitcoin politics for a moment. This message is about cryptocurrencies
design in general, so you're free to skip my message if you think it will
never apply to Bitcoin.

[ full article copied from my blog:
https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2015/08/16/how-decor-can-eradicate-selfish-mining-incentive-by-design/
]

A year ago I proposed the DECOR protocol
<https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/decor/>, a new rule for
cryptocurrencies to reduce significantly the amount of orphan blocks and
then allow block rate to be as high as one block every 5 seconds, and at
the same time it promised to address the problem of selfish mining
<http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/>. After one
year, I?ve received very little feedback about it. Yet the selfish mining
<http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/04/bitcoin-is-broken/> problem has
been argued over and over against certain changes in Bitcoin, as if selfish
mining were something inevitable to all POW-based cryptocurrencies. But it
is not.

In a nutshell, DECOR is a protocol that permits miners to share the block
reward if both mine competing blocks. This is done by publishing block
header siblings (sometime called uncles) into child blocks, and modifying
the cryptocurrency protocol to pay some amount to the miners of uncles. If
all miners are honest, this strategy increases slightly the probability of
1-block reversals, but reduces considerably the probability of longer
reversals, as all miners choose the same parent. A few months after my
post, Ethereum <https://www.ethereum.org/>adopted a similar strategy of
paying a certain amount of ether to uncles, but the amount paid was created
out of thin ear, and at that time there could be any amount of uncles, so
basically it distorted the money supply function into a uncapped
inflationary one, if all miners decided to collude. After I reported this
issue, they restricted the number of uncles that can be included, but still
it leaves an incentive for all miners to collude to increase miner revenue.
DECOR does reward sharing, so the supply function cap is maintained. But it
does not solve the Selfish mining problem: miners withholding a block get
paid a full reward but the remaining miners are working (without knowing
it) for a half of the block reward. So my original strategy does not work
for rational (but not necessarily honest) miners. A few posts later I
presented DECOR+ <https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2014/05/07/decor-2/> to try
to address the problem of unbalanced rewards: what happens if there are two
competing blocks, but one has a 12.5 BTC reward, but the other has a 20 BTC
reward due to additional fees? But again, if miners are dishonest, the
proposed scheme does not solve the underlying problem, as miners can
artificially increase their fees to win the conflict resolving rule, at
least in all cryptocurrencies that do not burn transaction fees. How can we
fix it?

*DECOR++*

We?ll fix DECOR by doing three changes. The first is by paying full rewards
to all competing blocks, either the parent or the uncles. To prevent
increasing the money supply, first we set a maximum number of uncles U than
can be included over a period of N blocks. For example we can set U=100 and
N=1000 (a maximum orphan rate of 10%). Then we create rule to decrease the
money supply per time interval in case it previously was increased. So to
prevent miners colluding to increase the money supply in U/N, we either
decrease the subsidies of the following N blocks by the excess amount in
the previous period or we make N coincident with block difficulty re-target
interval and we consider uncles in the rate computation, so mining
afterward simply gets more difficult. If all miners collude to try to
increase their revenue by U/N, they will see their revenue decrease by the
same amount in the following re-target interval.

Miners could start switching between two cryptocurrencies to mine only
during the low difficulty interval and avoid the high difficulty interval.
But here are no competing valuable non-merged mined cryptocurrency using
SHA256D, so this is no problem for Bitcoin. Also the cryptocurrency left
without mining power would become insecure and its price will fall to near
zero. So increasing the immaturity lock time for coinbases to at least N
blocks destroys any miner earnings if all decide to switch all at once.

The second change is to choose the parent block in case of conflict based
on a deterministic random selection in case of deciding between several
chains with the same accumulated difficulty but different tip: we order the
competing tip blocks by their hash digest values, we hash the hashes and we
use the resulting hash digest as seed to a PRNG to choose an index in the
sorted list of the block to choose as parent.

The third change is to process the transactions of all competing blocks
(the actual block and its siblings) in case of a conflict. The transactions
on the parent block will be processed first as normal. The others will be
processed in the order they are referenced in following child blocks.
Conflicting transactions (double-spends) present in uncle blocks with
respect to the main block are skipped, while obviously internal conflicts
in the uncle blocks make them invalid, as usual. Now, as long as the
subsidy dominates the fees, miners have no incentive to withhold blocks.

Let?s analyze what can happen in the long term, when fees dominate the
block reward. In the future there may be two kinds of transactions: public
transactions and private transactions. Public transactions are the current
standard transactions: they pay a fee in the standard way and are broadcast
over the public network. Private transactions may appear if miners decide
to negotiate inclusion in blocks directly with web wallets or gateways:
private transactions will pay fees as an output to the miner?s public key.
Blocks with high rewards competing with blocks with low rewards due to
public transactions will be rare, since for the benefit of the miner most
transactions included in blocks should be present in all other miners
memory pools to accelerate propagation, so all miners are exposed to the
same reward pool. If it happens (by the mistake of a user) that a public
transaction pays an extremely high fee, the withholding incentive may
reappear. But in a far future, when subsidy disappears and miners receive
the payment mainly because of fees, they may adopt the more competitive
commercial strategy of rely mainly in private transactions (or maybe using Mike
Hearn?s assurance contracts
<https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Funding_network_security>). As fees from
private transactions are not shared between competing blocks, they won?t
affect selfish mining. I conclude that DECOR++ is currently incentive
compatible and it is highly probable that remains incentive compatible in
the future.

To summarize, DECOR++ main protocol properties are:

   - Choose a parent by a deterministic pseudo-random coin toss based on
   competing block headers
   - Give standard subsidy to all competing blocks by including uncles in
   following blocks
   - Give small monetary incentive to include uncle blocks in blocks
   (miners including blocks can get a small share of included blocks rewards).
   - Give small monetary incentive to choose deterministically one of the
   competing blocks as the main block (this can be done by burning some reward
   share if other parent is chosen).
   - Process all transactions in uncle blocks, quietly skipping the ones
   that conflict with existing ones.
   - Pay fees to original miners for all non-conflicting transactions in
   uncle blocks
   - Decrease the money supply in blocks following blocks including uncles
   to compensate for the increase in money supply.
   - Limit the amount of uncles that can be included over an interval of
   blocks, and make that interval long enough to capture normal variances in
   orphan rates.
   - Increase the coinbase immaturity period to at least the period of
   money supply compensation.

Best regards, Sergio.

Hey folks,

so you've been stressed with arguing about what to do with the block size for 
months now :(

Why not realize that the unfruitful permanent need for administrators to tweak 
a magical, god-given (= Satoshi-given) constant is a *strong* indicator for 
something which should be delegated to a self-adjusting system instead?

    new_max_blocksize = some_averaging_function(previous_block_sizes);
    end_of_flamewar();
    continue_with_REAL_development();

Systems which do not require any human intervention are always more beautiful, 
and especially when trying to design a decentralized P2P network :)

Not necessarily some_averaging_function. Could also be something that
depends on how much work has been put in, i.e. make the miners do more
computational work if they want to add bigger blocks into the chain, and
the chain doesn't have to be the original chain, it could be a sidechain or
block extension, so as to not force people to upgrade.

Hi Eric,

Sorry you feel that way. I devoted a big part of the article to trying to
fairly represent the top 3 arguments made, but ultimately I can't link to a
clear statement of what Bitcoin Core thinks because there isn't one. Some
people think the block size should increase, but not now, or not by much.
Others think it should stay at 1mb forever, others think everyone should
migrate to Lightning, people who are actually *implementing* Lightning
think it's not a replacement for an increase ..... I think one or two
people even suggested shrinking the block size!

So I've done my best to sum up the top arguments. If you think I've done a
bad job, well, get writing and lay it out how you see it!

I don't think the position of "Bitcoin is open source but touching THESE
parts is completely bogus" is reasonable. Bitcoin is open source or it
isn't. You can't claim to be decentralised and open source, but then only
have 5 people who are allowed to edit the most important parts. That's
actually worse than central banking!

This isn?t a democracy - consensus is all or nothing.
>

This idea is one of the incorrect beliefs that will hopefully be disproven
in the coming months. Bitcoin cannot possibly be "all or nothing" because
as I pointed out before, that would give people a strong financial
incentive to try and hold the entire community to ransom: "I have 1
terahash/sec of mining power. Pay me 1000 BTC or I'll never agree to the
next upgrade".

Or indeed, me and Gavin could play the same trick.

?That's been really unclear to me. Personally, I'd love to see a vote from
the core and XT developers on:

 - what should the block size soft limit be in 12 months (min and max)
 - what should the block size hard limit be in 12 months (min and max)

 - at what rate should the hard limit grow over the next 10 years? (min and
max)

 - what mechanism should be used to update the soft limit
   (manual code change, time based, blockchain history, something else)
? - what me?chanism should be used to update the hard limit
   (hard fork code change, time based, blockchain history, something else)

Bonus:

? - what should the
?transaction ?
fee level be in 12 months (after the reward halves)??
 - what's a good measure of "(de)centralisation" and what value should
everyone aim for in 12 months?

As an interested newbie, I can't actually tell what most people think the
answers to most of those questions are. FWIW, mine would be:

 - soft limit in 12 months: 1MB-4MB
 - hard limit in 12 months: 2MB-20MB
 - hard limit grows at 17-40% a year (and should be >4x average txn volume)
 - update the soft limit by code changes or blockchain history
 - update the hardlimit by (1) fee level, (2) miner vote, (3) hard coded
time updates at a conservative (low) rate, (4) hard fork every couple of
years
 - transaction fees should in 12months should be lower per kB than today's
defaults, say 20%-50% of today's defaults in USD
 - number of bitcoin nodes, should be 20% higher in 12 months than it is now

?Cheers,
aj

Being a bitcoin software developer an entrepreneur for years I learned that success is not a direct consequence of technology and is not inevitable.
BitcoinXT manifesto (https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt#the-xt-manifesto) should resonate with many fellow entrepreneurs.
I applaud Mike and Gavin for creating that choice for us.

Hear hear Tamas,

I agree. I personally prefer to use the "only-bigblocks" branch and not XT
with all its features - but as I am not mining that doesn't mean much
anyhow. Nevertheless I am happy to be able to publicly proclaim my opinion
that the block size should be raised asap.

Thank you for going ahead Mike

Hey everyone,

as with the current "max block size" debate I was wondering: Is anyone here
in favor of a minimum block size (say 2 MB or so)? If so I would be
interested in an exchange (maybe off-list) of ideas. I am in favor of a
lower limit and am giving it quite a bit of thought at the moment.

Cheers

Levin, it is a complicated issue for which there isn't an easy answer. Part
of the issue is that "block size" doesn't actually measure resource usage
very reliably. It is possible to support a much higher volume of typical
usage transactions than transactions specifically constructed to cause DoS
issues. But if "block size" is the knob being tweaked, then you must design
for the DoS worst case, not the average/expected use case.

Additionally, there is an issue of time horizons and what presumed
improvements are made to the client. Bitcoin Core today can barely handle
1MB blocks, but that's an engineering limitation. So are we assuming fixes
that aren't actually deployed yet? Should we raise the block size before
that work is tested and its performance characteristics validated?

It's a complicated issue without easy answers, and that's why you're not
seeing straightforward statements of "2MB", "8MB", or "20MB" from most of
the developers.

But that's not to say that people aren't doing anything. There is a
workshop being organized for September 12-13th that will cover much of
these "it's complicated" issues. There will be a follow-on workshop in the
Nov/Dec timeframe in which specific proposals will be discussed. I
encourage you to participate:

Hi Tamas

Do you find BIP 101, BIP 102, BIP 103 and the flexcap proposal
deserving of equal consideration?  Just curious because of your post.

Will you be interested to participate in the BIP review process and
perhaps attend the workshop on Bitcoin scaling announced here
recently?

Hi Adam,

I welcomed XT for its declared focus on usability with current means.
I think there is also more room for non-consenus relevant P2P protocol flavors than a single code base can accommodate.
XT is also as Jeff just tweeted a relief valve.

It became important, that Bitcoin is able to evolve even if there are conflicting educated opinions.
If a review process serves decision making, then I?d be glad to participate.

I fail to see how voting with version numbers is different than voting with
coinbase scriptSig. Other than the fact that the voting XT is doing is
formally defined instead of ad-hoc.

[cross-posted to libbitcoin]

I applaud this effort not for the merits of the hard fork but on the
effects of the code fork. We have been witnessing the self-destruction
of Bitcoin's central authority. This is a necessary outcome.

Understandably, many are concerned that if consensus settles on a larger
block size Bitcoin will suffer greater centralization. The point of
Bitcoin however is that nobody is in control of consensus. If a
consensus decision leads to centralization, the consensus will move.

Yes, when this happens people who bet on the losing fork will lose
money. This is how Bitcoin works. One bets not on personal desires but
on what others will accept. That is how consensus is built.

Some fret that if this process evolves Bitcoin will suffer a
catastrophic loss of "value" and not recover. This may come to pass, but
there is no avoiding the possibility.

The ease with which consensus can move when it wants to is important. In
other words, friction is weakness and a single overly complex codebase
is high friction.

Amir saw this coming before most. While we are posting manifestos, I
thought it more than appropriate to quote from the libbitcoin manifesto:

I think that it is important to note that Bitcoin XT faces a natural
uphill battle.

Since it is possible to setup atomic inter-fork coin trades. I do not
see how Bitcoin XT could possibly win if Satoshi decides to sell 10000
XTBTC for BTC everyday for the first 100 days after the fork.

In many ways Satoshi gets to decide the winning fork just by his huge
economic investment in Bitcoin.


Here is some simple game-theory for non-consensus forks:

1. Spoil the ballot. Have Bitcoin Core propagate the Bitcoin XT version
string.

2. Encourage all miners to false vote for the Bitcoin XT fork.

- Now people have no-idea what % of the economy Bitcoin XT holds. -
Making it impossible for people to put economic faith behind Bitcoin XT.

3. Setup good Atomic Swap markets.

4. Setup a fork of Bitcoin XT that allows people to easily make a
transaction only on the XT fork (while leaving the original BTC coins
untouched).


This means that the Bitcoin XT fork will be born per-mature. Probably
with only a small % of hashing power behind it (contrary to the almost
100% that falsely claim to support it). It will be embarrassing that for
the goal of larger blocks, XT instead has blocks (before re-adjustment)
every 2h.


The price for XTBTC coins will plummet, Satoshi progressively dumping
his 1M stash over a year or so will make sure that it doesn't recover
either.


I cannot see how Bitcoin XT is but-not in a extremely weak position from
game theory.

I'm sure smarter people than I could come up with even more ways to
disrupt non-consensus forks.

Cam.

This would obliterate any confidence in Bitcoin Core. I seriously doubt
anyone would actually be ok with a pull request implementing this.

Who would bother writing this code, let alone trading on these markets?

I doubt this is even possible.

Since it was a game theory analysis. I will not address your other comments.

Trivial.

There are a few ways: here is my favorite (for the moment).

1. Spam the 8mb blocks with 1 Satoshi outputs to the brainwallet 'BitcoinXT'

2. Let these spam tx be in BitcoinXT, however not Bitcoin (easily done).

3. Let the forked XT client includes a unspent dust output with any
transaction. Let the this client create 100 dust outputs for other
people to use in the same transaction.

This transaction will only be possible to confirm with Bitcoin XT. -
Leaving your Bitcoin coins untouched.

I particularly like this approach, as it is ironic as the spam is more
cheaply done with larger blocks.

Cam.


A quick political note:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstentionism

Hard forks are not something that is a democratic process. Thus
frustrating a false-democratic process is completely legitimate.

"minimum" an interesting topic.

- Traffic levels may not produce a minimum size block
- Miners can always collude to produce a lowered maximum block size, a sort
of minimum maximum

The first question to answer here is simple:

What value would there be in requiring a minimum block size?

I see no value.

Thanks to mining centralization, such attempts won't be successful. 
Asking mining pools to mine spoofing blocks in their real name is even 
harder than asking them to run the real BitcoinXT

Node count is always manipulable, there is nothing new. People running 
this will only be interpreted as XT-supporters.

Even more direct: use coinbase outputs of  XT blocks to create those outputs, as they can't by definition be on the Bitcoin chain.

If you can't get those, using coinbase outputs of Bitcoin blocks to create "definitely Bitcoin-only" outputs, and then spend the inputs to those transactions again on the XT chain. This isn't quite as good, as a big reorg on the XT chain could in theory spend them, but it's a close second.

The fun thing about this, is you only need >25% of hashing power running Not-BitcoinXT to screw over the miners running XT, as XT blocks are valid Bitcoin blocks if they're on a valid Bitcoin chain.

75% upgrade thresholds have a lot of issues...

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miners are struggling with blocks far smaller than
 750KB blocks and resorting to SPV mining
Message-ID: <BLU172-W10F7A109C917CD56E7DF4DC2790@phx.gbl>

Hi all,
  I previously mentioned in a post that i believe that technically nodes are capable of handling blocks an order of magnitude larger than the current blocksize limit, the only missing thing was an incentive to run them. I have been monitoring the blockchain for the past couple of weeks and am seeing that even miners who have all the incentives are for whatever reason struggling to download and validate much smaller blocks.
The data actually paints a very grim picture of the current bandwidth/validating capacity of the global mining network.
See the following empty blocks mined despite a non-trivial elapsed time from the previous block just from the past couple of days alone (Data from insight.bitpay.com):

EmptyBlock /Time since previous block/ Size of previous block(bytes)/Mined by====================================================370165  29s  720784  Antpool370160  31s  50129    BTCChinaPool370076  49s  469988  F2Pool370059  34s  110994  Antpool370057  73s  131603  Antpool
We have preceding blocks as small as 50KB with 30s passing and the miner continues to mine empty blocks via SPV mining.
The most glaring case is Block 370057 where despite 73s elapsing and the preceding block being a mere 131KB, the miner is unable to download/validate fast enough to include transactions in his block. Unless ofcourse the miner is mining empty blocks on purpose, which does not make sense as all of these pools do mine blocks with transactions when the elapsed time is greater.

This is a cause for great concern, because if miners are SPV mining for a whole minute for <750KB blocks, at 8MB blocks, the network will just fall apart as a significant portion of the hashing power SPV mines throughout. All a single malicious miner has to do is mine an invalid block on purpose, let these pools SPV mine on top of them while it mines a valid block free of their competition. Yes, these pools deserve to lose money in that event, but the impact of reorgs and many block orphans for anyone not running a full node could be disastrous, especially more so in the XT world where Mike wants everyone to be running SPV nodes. I simply don't see the XT fork having any chance of surviving if SPV nodes are unreliable. 
And if these pools go out of business, it will lead to even more mining centralization which is already too centralized today.

Can anyone representing these pools comment on why this is happening? Are these pools on Matt's relay network?

The traffic between the pool server and individual hashers is far busier 
than 50kB/30s. If their bandwidth is so limited, hashers would have 
switched to other pools already.

All these data may prove is they have very bad mining codes. For 
example, their hashers may not be required to update the transaction 
list regularly. I don't think they are struggling. They are just too 
lazy or think that's too risky to improve their code. After all, they 
are generating half million USD per day and a few seconds of downtime 
would hurt.

By the way, vast majority of the full blocks (>0.99MB) on the blockchain 
are generated by Chinese pools.

I have tried to solve the maximum block size debate, depending on the
previous block size calculation.

You mean the bunch of self-proclaimed Bitcoin wizards, who decided they have the right to tell everybody what to do, and who never got to grow up and are now angry at the world for not listening to them anymore? That "technical consensus"?

"Bitcoin is decentralized, but you are only allowed to do what we tell you to do. It's our pet project, we wrote code for it!"

That's what it all boils down to, all these dirty games of calling XT an alt-coin and censoring its posts, pretending to be Satoshi, sabotaging XT switch, etc.: "How dare they not listen to Us The Smartest anymore?!!!"

Pathetic. The history will roll over you in a blink. The harder you try, the quicker it will go.

I guess I am nobody. Here's a copy of the text:-

*Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap
<http://upalc.com/maxblocksize.php>*

*Assumption*: This article is for those, who already understand the bitcoin
protocol and aware of the block size controversy. Details of the problem
statement can be found in BIP 100
<http://gtf.org/garzik/bitcoin/BIP100-blocksizechangeproposal.pdf>.
Satoshi's opinion regarding block size can be found here
<https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1347.msg15366#msg15366>. I will be
directly going into the solution without explaining the problem in details.


*Solution*: Difficulty changes at every 2016 block, i.e. at every 2016
block each full node does a calculation to find the next target. We will do
just another calculation here. Nodes will also calculate what % of blocks
in the last difficulty period is higher than 90% of the maximum block size,
which is 1 MB for now. If it is found that more than 90% blocks in the last
difficulty period is higher than 90% of the maximum block size, then double
the maximum block size. If not, then calculate what % of blocks in the last
difficulty period is less than 50% of the maximum block size. If it is
higher than 90%, then half the maximum block size. If none of the above
condition satisfies, keep the maximum block size as it is.

Please note that, while calculating the % of blocks, it is better to take
into account the first 2000 of the 2016, than the whole of 2016. This helps
to avoid the calculation mistake if some of the last few blocks get
orphaned.


*Reasoning*: This solution is derived directly from the indication of the
problem. If transaction volume increases, then we will naturally see bigger
blocks. On the contrary, if there are not enough transaction volume, but
maximum block size is high, then only few blocks may sweep the mempool.
Hence, if block size is itself taken into consideration, then maximum block
size can most rationally be derived. Moreover, this solution not only
increases, but also decreases the maximum block size, just like difficulty.

When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement.  Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto.  Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it.  By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the "original vision" they claim to honour.

However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions.  For example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network.  Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.

That made it to the news and is now discussed in various places. Could

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap
Message-ID: <CABerxhEwA7Pz0hdSuOf+RwWZiZpY1fSArB+UiyVUwr6S2fr3vQ@mail.gmail.com>

Words cannot capture how much I wish Satoshi had put logic like this (or
even just a simple block size doubling every reward halving) in place when
he put in the "temporary" 1MB anti-spam block size limit...

I see problems to this approach.  The biggest one I see is that a miner
with 11% of hash power could sabotage block size increases by only ever
mining empty blocks.

I haven't run any statistics or simulations, but I'm concerned that the
interplay between the random distribution of transaction arrival and the
random distribution of block times may lead to false signals.

A 90% full block 1 minute after the previous block is a more "serious"
problem than a 90% full block 30 minutes after the previous block.  A 90%
full block after a 90% full block is a more "serious" problem than a 90%
full block after an empty block.

I would expect a robust approach in this manner to look at block sizes
weighted by block times, but this is an interesting proposal regardless.

But I think you'll run up against one of the great schisms in this debate -
those that believe blocks should always be full (or close to it), to
encourage a "fee market" and to encourage off-chain transactions, and those
that think that the blockchain should be useable by almost anyone for
almost anything, implying there should always be spare space in blocks,
with off-chain transactions reserved for microtransactions and zero-conf
(and possibly low-fee transactions).  At least, that's my take on it.

Wouldn't that require a fork that lasts for more than 100 blocks?

Or can?t you create a transaction that?s still within the op count and sig ops limits but is larger than 1MB?

I've been sharing a similar solution for the past 2 weeks. I think 2016
blocks is too much of a wait, I think we should look at the mean block size
during the last 60-120 minutes instead and avert any crisis caused by
transactional spikes that could well be caused by organic use of the
network (Madonna sells her next tour tickets on Bitcoin, OpenBazaar network
starts working as imagined, XYZ startup really kicks ass and succeeds in a
couple of major cities with major PR push)

Pseudo code in Python
https://gist.github.com/gubatron/143e431ee01158f27db4

My idea stems from a simple scalability metric that affects real users and
the desire to use Bitcoin:
Waiting times to get your transactions confirmed on the blockchain.
Anything past 45mins-1 hour should be unnacceptable.

Initially I wanted to measure the mean time for the transactions in blocks
to go from being sent by the user
(initial broadcast into mempools) until the transaction was effectively
confirmed on the blockchain, say for 2 blocks (acceptable 15~20mins)

When blocks get full, people start waiting unnaceptable times for their
transactions to come through
if they don't adjust their fees. The idea is to avoid that situation at all
costs and keep the network
churning to the extent of its capabilities, without pretending a certain
size will be right at some
point in time, nobody can predict the future, nobody can predict real
organic usage peaks
on an open financial network, not all sustained spikes will come from
spammers,
they will come from real world use as more and more people think of great
uses for Bitcoin.

I presented this idea to measure the mean wait time for transactions and I
was told
there's no way to reliably meassure such a number, there's no consensus
when transactions are still
in the mempool and wait times could be manipulated. Such an idea would have
to include new timestamp fields
on the transactions, or include the median wait time on the blockheader
(too complex, additional storage costs)

This is an iteration on the next thing I believe we can all agree is 100%
accurately measured, blocksize.
Full blocks are the cause why many transactions would have to be waiting in
the mempool, so we should be able
to also use the mean size of the blocks to determine if there's a
legitimate need to increase or reduce the
maximum blocksize.

The idea is simple, If blocks are starting to get full past a certain
threshold then we double the blocksize
limit starting the next block, if blocks remain within a healthy bound,
transaction wait times should be as
expected for everyone on the network, if blocks are not getting that full
and the mean goes below a certain
threshold then we half the maximum block size allowed until we reach the
level we need.
Similar to what we do with hashing difficulty, it's something you can't
predict, therefore no fixed limits,
or predicted limits should be established.

You could just take the average of all the block sizes for the last 2016
window.

If average of last 2016 > 50% of the limit, then increase by 6.25%
Otherwise, decrease by 6.25%

This means that the average would be around 50% of the limit.  This gives
margin to create larger blocks when blocks are happening slowly.

A majority of miners could force the limit upwards by creating spam but
full blocks.

It could be coupled with a hard limit that grows at whatever is seen as the
maximum reasonable.  This would be both a maximum and a minimum.

All of these schemes add state to the system.  If the schedule is
predictable, then you can check determine the maximum block size purely
from the header and coinbase.

Hi,

If you want to write such baseless acusations and inflamatory phrases, please do it somewhere else. We should have the highest respect for what these people are doing, and we should try to do something constructive, not waste time with anger and disrespect.

Nobody should be forced to do anything. People like you will not force me or anyone else to run code for your controversial hard fork just because you think the future will be bright with huge blocks. Just like the developers will not force you to continue running code implementing the current consensus rules.

The developers are not telling you what to do, they are trying to do what they consider is best for the ecosystem given their technical abilities.

Valiz

 You mean
 the bunch of self-proclaimed Bitcoin wizards, who decided
 they have the right to tell everybody what to do, and who
 never got to grow up and are now angry at the world for not
 listening to them anymore? That "technical
 consensus"?
 
 "Bitcoin is decentralized, but you are
 only allowed to do what we tell you to do. It's our pet
 project, we wrote code for it!"
 
 That's what it all boils down to, all these
 dirty games of calling XT an alt-coin and censoring its
 posts, pretending to be Satoshi, sabotaging XT switch, etc.:
 "How dare they not listen to Us The Smartest
 anymore?!!!"
 
 Pathetic.
 The history will roll over you in a blink. The harder you
 try, the quicker it will go.

One of the comments made by the mining pools is that they won't run XT
because it is "experimental".

Has there been any consideration to making available a version of XT with
only the blocksize changes?

The least "experimental" version would be one that makes the absolute
minimum changes to core.

The MAX_BLOCK_SIZE parameter could be overwritten whenever the longest tip
changes.  This saves creating a new function.

Without the consensus measuring code, the patch would be even easier.
Satoshi's proposal was just a block height comparison (a year in advance).

The state storing code is also another complication.  If the standard
"counting" upgrade system was used, then no state would need to be stored
in the database.

Why, exactly, should I have any respect for what these people are doing (and supposedly not have any respect for what the other side is doing)?

Great, so how about you go tell theymos to stop censoring XT posts and banning the other side on /r/Bitcoin?

Let users decide what Bitcoin is or isn't.

The developers & Co are doing their best to stay in power, so they could continue imposing their will on Bitcoin ecosystem. This is the real power grab, not Gavin and Hearn, who merely provided an alternative.

And the fear they show is most telling.

NxtChg,

In the entire history of Bitcoin we?ve never attempted anything even closely resembling a hard fork like what?s being proposed here.

Many of us have wanted to push our own hard-forking changes to the protocol?and have been frustrated because of the inability to do so.

This inability is not due to any malice on anyone?s part?it is a feature of Satoshi?s protocol. For better or worse, it is *very hard* to change the rules?and this is exactly what imbues Bitcoin with one of its most powerful attributes: very well-defined settlement guarantees that cannot be suddenly altered nor reversed by anyone.

We?ve managed to have a few soft forks in the past?and for the most part these changes have been pretty uncontroversial?or at least, they have not had nearly the level of political divisiveness that this block size issue is having. And even then, we?ve encountered a number of problems with these deployments that have at times required goodwill cooperation between developers and mining pool operators to fix.

Again, we have NEVER attempted anything even remotely like what?s being proposed - we?ve never done any sort of hard fork before like this. If even fairly uncontroversial soft forks have caused problems, can you imagine the kinds of potential problems that a hard fork over some highly polarizing issue might raise? Do you really think people are going to want to cooperate?!?

I can understand that some people would like bigger blocks. Other people might want feature X, others feature Y?and we can argue the merits of this or that to death?but the fact remains that we have NEVER attempted any hard forking change?not even with a simple, totally uncontroversial no-brainer improvement that would not risk any sort of ill-will that could hamper remedies were it not to go as smoothly as we like. *THIS* is the fundamental problem - the whole bigger block thing is a minor issue by comparison?it could be any controversial change, really.

Would you want to send your test pilots on their first flight?the first time an aircraft is ever flown?directly into combat without having tested the plane? This is what attempting a hard fork mechanism that?s NEVER been done before in such a politically divisive environment basically amounts to?but it?s even worse. We?re basically risking the entire air force (not just one plane) over an argument regarding how many seats a plane should have that we?ve never flown before.

We?re talking billlions of dollars? worth of other people?s money that is on the line here. Don?t we owe it to them to at least test out the system on a far less controversial, far less divisive change first to make sure we can even deploy it without things breaking? I don?t even care about the merits regarding bigger blocks vs. smaller blocks at this point, to be quite honest - that?s such a petty thing compared to what I?m talking about here. If we attempt a novel hard-forking mechanism that?s NEVER been attempted before (and which as many have pointed out is potentially fraught with serious problems) on such a politically divisive, polarizing issue, the result is each side will refuse to cooperate with the other out of spite?and can easily lead to a war, tanking the value of everyone?s assets on both chains. All so we can process 8 times the number of transactions we currently do? Even if it were 100 times, we wouldn?t even come close to touching big payment processors like Visa. It?s hard to imagine a protocol improvement that?s worth the risk.

I urge you to at least try to see the bigger picture here?and to understand that nobody is trying to stop anyone from doing anything out of some desire for maintaining control - NONE of us are able to deploy hard forks right now without facing these problems. And different people obviously have different priorities and preferences as to which of these changes would be best to do first. This whole XT thing is essentially giving *one* proposal special treatment above those that others have proposed. Many of us have only held back from doing this out of our belief that goodwill amongst network participants is more important than trying to push some pet feature some of us want.

Please stop this negativity - we ALL want the best for Bitcoin and are doing our best, given what we understand and know, to do what?s right.

Yadayadayada.

If someone could threaten the network by releasing a hard-forking bitcoind
version, then already all is lost. Bitcoins stability does not (and cannot)
depend on the "good will" of anyone. If it would, we should all abandon
this silly project. Relying on the good will of people is the worst idea
one could have.

So please (please please) go ahead and release your hardforking bitcoinds
you have been holding back. Competition is everything.

Cheers

Levin

Levin,

The hope is that eventually the network will be sufficiently resilient and robust to be able to handle anything that?s thrown at it. But it?s still a baby?and this is a serious problem indeed, because on the one hand we don?t want any central authority but on the other it still needs some guardians?and we don?t have anything resembling the kind of institution that could possibly be entrusted to nurture and care for this baby until it is ready to go out on its own.

Imagine, when the US Constitution was being written, if suddenly everyone started to just propose their own different version of it and insisting (under threat of fork) on their own versions before any sort of government could be created. Yes, I know the US federal government is not exactly the paragon of decentralization?but regardless of your views on the US government, it?s still a somewhat analogous situation. Until the system was in place, some people (who at the time were unelected) had to bootstrap the process.

For better or worse, Satoshi has left the picture?and no clear succession model was put in place. The Bitcoin Foundation, which for a time attempted to be a guardian institution, ended up self-destructing. It was an utter failure.

We don?t have any sort of institution like this?and we don?t really want one. But the system is still not fully in place. Importantly, we lack any mechanisms to be able to make potentially controversial changes without serious risks.

It would be amazing if despite this trial-by-fire we still survived and managed to pull through. And if we do we?ll be stronger for it. But quite sincerely, I would have wanted the system to be a little more mature before putting it through this trial. At least I would have liked to have gone through a test hard-fork using a far less politically divisive issue.

Anyhow, completely separate from my views on governance, etc?my main point is that we?re ALL trying to do what?s best given our understanding and resources?and we?ve all poured our hearts and souls into this. We might disagree on certain things, but let?s stop this negativity and misrepresentation and try to figure out a way forward that is less likely to lead to a war.


- Eric

Thank you Eric for saying what needs to be said.

Starting a fork war is just not constructive and there are multiple
proposals being evaluated here.

I think that one thing that is not being so much focussed on is
Bitcoin-XT is both a hard-fork and a soft-fork.  It's a hard-fork on
Bitcoin full-nodes, but it is also a soft-fork attack on Bitcoin core
SPV nodes that did not opt-in.  It exposes those SPV nodes to loss in
the likely event that Bitcoin-XT results in a network-split.

The recent proposal here to run noXT (patch to falsely claim to mine
on XT while actually rejecting it's blocks) could add enough
uncertainty about the activation that Bitcoin-XT would probably have
to be aborted.

I don't think rising fees is the issue.

Imagine that the government is worried because air lines are selling
tickets cheaply and may run themselves out of business. So their
solution is passing a new law that says only one commercial air plane is
allowed to be in the air at any given time.

This should help a ticket market to develop and prevent air lines from
giving away almost free tickets. In this way the government can protect
the air lines from themselves.

I would not classify all issues that would come out of this as
"potential indirect consequences of rising ticket prices."

It would just make air travel unusable.

That's the problem we may face in the short term.

It would be unwise to go all-in on a solution that doesn't exist yet,
which may or may not arrive in time, and may or may not do the job that
is needed. We need to use the solution we already have so that we can
get by in the short term.

I don't think mining pools will immediately make blocks as big as
possible if the hard limit is raised. Remember that mining pools had to
be coaxed into increasing their block size. Mining pools were making
small blocks to reduce the rate of orphaned blocks. Block propagation is
faster today, but this issue still exists. You need a lot of transaction
fees to make up for the danger of losing 25 BTC. Many pools don't even
pay out transaction fee income to their miners.

Adam,

While greatly appreciating your prior efforts in crypto-ccy R&D and
current efforts for Blockstream, its not a plus for your reputation to be
using emotive terms like ?attack?, ?fork war" and throwing so much FUD
into the developer email channel directly after Eric?s email.

We would appreciate seeing your well-argued thoughts, not FUD and flaming.
There are multitudes of trolls in all forums already.

Dear Eric,

thank you for sharing your thoughts.

It obviously boils down to political beliefs, not so much technical
arguments. I understand that you are in favor of a "guided
decentralization" and you are most happily invited to follow this path. I
don't want to be on it. I want total decentralisation of bitcoin and many
other parts of the current system.

So in the end the hard fork might be perfect, because people like you will
not waste so much more energy and time fighting people like me (and others)
who are following different dogmata because we are using different coins
and talking about different code. Interestingly enough in the end we will
probably have a winner - determined by the price - so I am looking forward
to the outcome. It is just the time so make some bets, which I embrace.

Another interesting thing is, that you actually fear problems arising from
this. What do you have to loose? Just stick with the old bitcoin version
and weather this storm. Bitcoin is not going to vanish or break from this.
It is just forking. One fork will come stronger out of this. You just have
to choose a side and live with it, if you loose it all. But that is the
story of bitcoin since the beginning. If you ask me, you fear the choice,
not the change.

Cheers

Levin

I understand that you are in favor of a "guided decentralization" and you are most happily invited to follow this path. I don't want to be on it.

I specifically asked you to stop misrepresenting - I?m NOT in favor of guided decentralization, I never said anything like that. *THIS* is the problem?you?re reading intentions into others that simply are NOT there. If you don?t really understand something, ask.

I want complete decentralization - but for practical reasons, which should be obvious, we cannot start at this point. Bitcoin came into existence because Satoshi wrote a whitepaper and implemented the idea - and it was his rules. There was no voting, no committee, no proof-of-work, no nothing?it was a complete dictatorship in the beginning.

Don?t we owe it to them to at least test out the system on a far less controversial, far less divisive change first to make sure we can even deploy it without things breaking? I don?t even care about the merits regarding bigger blocks vs. smaller blocks at this point, to be quite honest - that?s such a petty thing compared to what I?m talking about here. If we attempt a novel hard-forking mechanism that?s NEVER been attempted before (and which as many have pointed out is potentially fraught with serious problems) on such a politically divisive, polarizing issue, the result is each side will refuse to cooperate with the other out of spite?and can easily lead to a war, tanking the value of everyone?s assets on both chains. All so we can process 8 times the number of transactions we currently do? Even if it were 100 times, we wouldn?t even come close to touching big payment processors like Visa. It?s hard to imagine a protocol improvement that?s worth the risk.

Many of us have only held back from doing this out of our belief that goodwill amongst network participants is more important than trying to push some pet feature some of us want.

Note that XT includes a patch that sets the soft limit to be the same as the hard limit by default, so if miners did use the defaults "as big as possible" blocks would be produced.

Eric,

>In the entire history of Bitcoin we've never attempted anything even closely resembling a hard fork like what's being proposed here.

These concerns are understandable. What's hard to understand is why he, he and he get to decide what is more risky - hitting the limit or forking for larger blocks?

Many people don't seem to think the upcoming hard fork is such a big risk.

---

And why there's so much fear that your side might lose to XT in a honest battle? Why is it suddenly not "let the best man win", but "we are right, they are enemies of the state, go get them!!!"?

This is the same fear dictators have of honest elections. If you know you can't win in a honest battle, you start rigging the game.

With recent "Satoshi" post even this list is not immune...

----

I don't know if everybody had a chance to appreciate this quote by theymos yet:

"If 90% of /r/Bitcoin users find these policies to be intolerable, then I want these 90% of /r/Bitcoin users to leave."

(https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h9cq4/its_time_for_a_break_about_the_recent_mess/)

This is a quote worthy of Gaddafi. Fortunately, it's hard to be a dictator on the Internet, where you can't shoot people.

BIP99 (still a draft too) currently recommends a minimum height plus
95% mining upgrade confirmation (aka "miner voting") after that for
uncontroversial hardforks:

https://github.com/jtimon/bips/blob/bip-forks/bip-0099.mediawiki#Uncontroversial_hardforks
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009837.html

But general hardfork activation discussion is still inconclusive in
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009731.html

The code for the example uncontroversial hardfork proposed in bip99 is
at: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/0.11...jtimon:hardfork-timewarp-0.11
But I haven't created a PR for either the code or the bip yet.

You may be interested in this patch/PR:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6382

Why only one more testchain when you can add
std::numeric_limits<uint64_t>::max() new testchains with approximately
the same code?

I don't think is all that interesting to make miners vote on lower
limit. Say the community wants to reduce the size to limit mining
centralization, it's not unthinkable that the hashrate majority (which
may have to face more competition or harvest less transactions after
the change) may oppose to that and then the community is forced to
deploy an anti-miner's hardfork (maybe even asic-reset hardfork?)
instead of a softfork.
Yes, uncontroversial sofforks are easier and less risky to deploy than
uncontroversial hardforks, but anti-miner hardforks are not.
Not only I don't think it's a good idea for miners to vote on the
block size (which is there to control them), I don't even buy the
assumption that "we can always just softfork a smallwer size later".
If you give something to miners they may not want to give it back later.
We could hardfork to 42 M supply and then "just softfork back to 21 M", right?
Or what's the same, we could "just softfork supply to 15 M". Such a
change would be clearly controversial among miners, so it wouldn't be
an uncontroversial softfork anymore. Some of these cases are discussed
in BIP99.

One could think that this could help with things like SPV mining, but
miners can just pay to themselves to follow the minimum size block
rule without risking anything.
As long as they have a singled matured satoshi they can just pay to
themselves with it as many times as they need in the same block.

You mean to avoid discussions about his authenticity?

FWIW,

I don?t think what theymos did is very constructive.I understand his position?but it only hurts the cause, unfortunately - the PR battle is not the same thing as a discussion on technical merits. He hurts the PR battle and plays into Mike?s hand by doing that. The actual underlying issue actually has little to do with block size - it has to do with Mike and Gavin feeling that the core devs are being obstructionist.

Regardless of the technical merits of XT, the fact that we?ve never done a hard fork before, not even for things some other devs have wanted?and not due to any malice on anyone?s part but because simply that?s just the nature of decentralized consensus with well-defined settlement guarantees?this is the problem - Mike and Gavin think they?re somehow special and their fork should be pushed while the rest of us resist pushing our own controversial pet ideas because we want civility and understand that at this stage in Bitcoin?s development trying to fork the blockchain over highly divisive issues is counterproductive and destructive.

But the fact of the matter is that in the PR battle, arguments against the fork actually play into Mike?s hand, and that?s the problem.

The whole block size thing is too nuanced and too easily spun simplistically. It?s too easy to spin resistance to bigger blocks (even though the resistance is actually much more towards untested hardforking mechanisms and serious security concerns) as ?obstructionism? and it?s too easy to spin bigger blocks as ?scalability? because most of the people can?t tell the fucking difference.

The fact is most of the people don?t really understand the fundamental issue and are taking sides based on charismatic leadership and authority which is actually entirely counter to the spirit of decentralized consensus. It?s beyond ironic.

If you guys want to win the PR battle, the key is to make it clear that you are not obstructionist and are giving everyone equal treatment?Bitcoin was designed such that changing the rules is *hard* and this is a feature. Bitcoin simply does not have a reliable and tested hard forking mechanism?and a hard fork for such a politically divisive issue will almost certainly lead to a lack of cooperation and refusal to work together out of spite. All of us would like to be able to process more transactions on the network. It?s not a matter of whether we think higher capacity is a bad thing - it?s more that some of us are concerned that Bitcoin is not sufficiently mature to be able to handle such a schism with so much hostility.

Let?s face it, folks - from a PR standpoint, the block size issue is irrelevant. Nobody really understands it except for a handful of people - I?ve tried to explain it, I?ve even written articles about it - but most people just don?t get it. Most people don?t really get scalability either - they seem to think that scalability is just doing the same thing you?ve always done manyfold.

Block size is an especially dangerous issue politically because it?s one of those that requires deep understanding yet superficially sounds really simple. It?s perfect Dunning-Kruger bait.

So let?s be a little smarter about this.

why?
wouldn't a bigger block size actually allow for more transactions per
block, therefore more fees to be collected, and the cost spread out among
many more users (thus still keeping tx fees low). If anything, wouldn't
bigger blocksizes are needed to suplement the losses of coinbase rewards
being halfed.

I should add that in the interest of peace and goodwill, I extend an offer to both Mike and Gavin to make their grievances heard?but only on the condition that we make a good effort to avoid misrepresentation and misreading of the other side?s intentions.

It just creates confusion. Particularly in the media. I also find it
unfair if people abuses Satoshi's name to submit their personal views on
an issue.

Did you self-assigned a bip number?

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki


Anyway, from your document:

"The existing (2015) Big Data analysis market is valued at around
$125bn according to market

research firm IDC. As the Bitcoin block chain replaces existing
payment systems and attracts

millions or hundreds of millions of users, the intrinsic value of the
data in the block chain

will increase and be attractive to data analytics businesses and block
chain start-ups."

Without even entering about details related to technical feasibility,
do you realize that you are proposing Bitcoin to become the most
orwellian money ever?
That this is the opposite of what many proposals and designs like
coinjoin try to achieve?

I think (hope?) that this idea doesn't have any chance of being
accepted by the Bitcoin community.

Yes, people have been abusing his name in the block size debate to
present their own personal views, almost from the beginning, and that
has been very annoying.
But I don't remember you proposing to block their emails from the list
in those occasions.
For all I know this could have been the real Satoshi. But I just
maintain what I've said when arguments of authority (an old fallacy)
have been used: only the arguments matter, not who makes them (which
is also what logic says).
Maybe the people using the arguments of authority actually care about
whether the author is Satoshi or not to determine what they think
about what the content says.
But I personally don't care: I can say that I agree with what the post
says no matter if it is written by Satoshi or someone else (because
the identity of the author doesn't change what I think of the
content).

so you want us to, (i) at the moment of payment decide wether to pay a tx
fee, or to include some data about what the transaction is about...
(ii) and (iii) are out of the question as you'd be forcing people to not
have privacy, which is one of the main reasons people use bitcoin, just
paying like cash.

then the rest goes down hill.

1. You want to add more data to a transaction, which would fill blocks even
faster.

2. The data will be on the blockchain, why in hell would anybody pay the
miners for it when you can just mine it yourself, or pay XYZ online service
to give you the tools you mention, and why would XYZ company pay miners for
the revenues of such service?

because... you want to change the Bitcoin license from MIT to something
else?

I'm sorry. this is dead on arrival, very unrealistic. Perhaps this will
work for some other coin where people accept all these orwellianism from
the start.

If you think there's much debate about blocksize you've no idea how things
would get at the mention of moving away from MIT into some sort of
commercial license, that would indeed destroy Bitcoin from being adopted as
it would enter into many many conflicts that would render it unusable by
lots of organizations.

You seem to be assuming that there is specific reason to believe the
message is unauthentic.  This is not the case.

Contrary to other poster's claims, if the message had been PGP signed
that might, in fact, have arguably been weak evidence that it was
unauthentic: no message from the system's creator that I (or
apparently anyone) was aware of was ever signed with that key.

The headers on the message check out.  The mail server in question is
also not an open relay.  At the moment the only reason I have to doubt
the authenticity of it is merely the fact that it exists after so much
air silence, but that isn't especially strong.

In the presence of doubt, it's better to take it just for its content.
And on that front it is more on-topic, civil, and productively
directed than a substantial fraction of new messages on the list.  I
certainly do not see a reason to hide it.

A focus on the content is especially relevant because one of the core
messages in the content is a request to eschew arguments from
authority; which is perhaps the greatest challenge here: How can the
founder of a system speak up to ask people to reject that kind of
argument without implicitly endorsing that approach through their own
act?

This whole tangest is a waste of time.  If you believe the message is
unauthentic or not the best response is the same as if it is
authentic. Focus on the content. If its worth responding to, do. If
it's not don't. Then move on with life.

In times of controversy or flamewar on the Linux kernel mailing list,
occasionally fake "Linus Torvalds" or other spoofed posts would appear.  It
is the nature of email.  Just ignore it.

For the record I would like to share my technical analysis of the Satoshi
email which I wrote in a pastebin (http://pastebin.com/Ct5M8fa2) a few days
ago.

1. The email is the one used by Satoshi to announce Bitcoin in the first
place.
http://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-October/014810.html

2. The email was not spoofed, it actually originated from vistomail's
server. The email headers show the email originated from 190.97.163.93 and
the SPF records show this as an authorised sender for the email. This does
not prove the account wasn't hacked of course, or that the account might
have expired and be re-registered by someone else (vistomail is a paid for
email provider).

3. While the email is not signed, and there are a number of PGP keys listed
on key servers for him (to vary addresses), he didnt sign any emails with
any PGP keys.

It is therefore not possible to outright dismiss the email's authenticity
as the email originates from an authentic source. The only questions is
whether the webmail service was hacked or commandeered somehow.

I'm sure that most people here were skeptical, but FWIW, the server that
hosts vistomail.com is a mess, it's a Plesk box with more than a couple of
services with dubious security histories. MailEnable smtpd, MSRPC, RDP, see

Most likely someone popped the box and is entertaining themselves.

Dude, while it does appear plausible that the box is insecure, is it truly
warranted to jump to any particular conclusion from that alone?

What if all the open ports is just because it is a honey pot?

Satoshi,

As much as I want to believe this is you it's very difficult to ignore the
fact that Vistomail could have been hacked and I'm currently speaking to a
troll.
Can you copy and paste what you wrote above, to
http://p2pfoundation.ning.com as well, like how you did during the Dorian
fiasco?


Much appreciated.

This bitcoin-dev list restarted with an empty subscriber list on June 21st,
2015.  So whoever posted from satoshi at vistomail.com subscribed and verified
the address recently.  Do you propose that we manually approve new

Is he talking about "full nodes" i.e. validating-only, or nodes in the
sense of the original whitepaper (i.e. miners)? Because there is already
plenty of incentive for running a node (i.e. the coinbase).

The issue is that the reward is more or less like a decentralised lottery
with high entry cost. If the income could be smoothed like in a mining
pool, without actually being a mining pool, then perhaps more people would
pay to enter the mining game. A bit like making P2Pool the one and only
pool allowed on the network.

Something I only recently realised is that Satoshi's apparent policy(1)
of never making any cryptographically secure signatures to link together
his posts - or indeed any communication at all - fits well with the
avoidance of creating a central authority figure. Currently every single
thing Satoshi ever apparently wrote can only be linked together by
trusting third parties - email archives could have been hacked,
bitcointalk might have fake messages, etc. Obviously in practice we have
reasonable assurance that the same person or group was behind most of
the messages we now consider to be "from Satoshi", but ultimately
strictly speaking we can only take each message individually, for the
arguments contained within.

As you've often said, the biggest achievement by Satoshi in the creation
of Bitcoin was to create a system where the identity of the creator is a
mere historical footnote. We can probably go further, and state that
while doing so, Satoshi quite counter-intuitively took steps to avoid
even creating a pseudoanonymous identity.

One can mine without running a node, unfortunately, thats where the
comments about pooled mining come from.

Also, this distionction between full nodes that "Validate" and
(presumably) SPV wallets that don't validate isn't consistent with the
design of Bitcoin.

Thats been suggested, though scalablity reasons make this hard: in the
P2Pool design there is a substantial tradeoff in variance reduction vs
communicatoin costs.

Pools could be somehow required to do p2pool between them, but there
would still be pools to further reduce variance, no?

Hello,

I might have a "crazy" simple solution.
>From the literature I read, it seems that Satochi has the keys that would
authenticate him using Bitcoin.

HBO John Oliver's program might have given me (and hopefully others) the
brilliant idea to protect the Bitcoin network from the overzealous reach of
the politicians. One need to start a Church, and to start the Church one
need funds (121UZ1hDs9MgCHonA8vjXr89D8FuDf5c7t) to start.

John Oliver's program on HBO about Churches (and the hypocrisy of some) was
epic and such entity could argue that Bitcoin is a belief system (which it
is) and would force the issue at a Federal level under the Church and State
separation. - John's video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg

At this time, I am waiting for the License issue to walk its course in New
York State.

Currently:

   - I am waiting for my License to be denied (to protest) and appeal it.
   - Waiting to hear from the License process to appeal the law in general.
   - Meeting Elected officials (in New York City, NY State, and France) and
   educating them on Bitcoin.

Every time we (the community) talk about Bitcoin, it can sound like
religion; therefore why not go all the way and do what John Oliver did ?
Seed money would help. :)

Regarding the Fork, from my perspective of a small company, I see that like
it was with IRC with the ICMP node split. The Church thing is not here to
take side but to "try" to protect the Bitcoin.

We will need to ordain ministers selected after completing prescribed
courses of study setup by the developers.

In short I am asking Satochi to help this church with original coins. If it
is a troll, I am talking to the Dev Community at large to recruit them to
ordain the ministers.

I would simply block the creators old email addresses. Easy with
Mailman. I thought that would be a good and easy approach, but maybe I'm
wrong.

Some believes it is possible that the email could be genuine. Some say
that only the content is important. I have closely followed. An
interesting discussion. Thank you all so far.

But let's say the poster would be the real Satoshi. Would we discuss his
posting if he would not claim to be Satoshi? There are a lot of smart
people on this list, which publish occasionally quite useful ideas. But
much of this is hardly the subject of greater discussion. Especially not
when it comes to the blocksize. On this subject almost everything has
been already said. But not yet by everyone. Especially not by Satoshi.

Satoshi would have a decisive influence on the community. I'm sure. To
say it does not matter who's talking is maybe genteelly but a little bit
remote from everyday life. Or not? Satoshi is the creator. What he says
is in the newspaper and is perceived by all. If he says it's okay to do
nothing as long as we stand together, then people have the courage to do
maybe something dangerous or something wrong. Then people only follow
their hearts. Otherwise they follow their fear. It is a paradox of the
human nature that some type of Dictatorship can make you free. I say
some type, not any type. Enough said.

Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution.  I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.

Re: full nodes, my thinking along those lines has been:

1) Incentivising full-nodes is a red herring

We can look at this from multiple angles. From the point of view of a
wallet, it's not very secure to use Hearn-style SPV mode, and volunteers
running full nodes doesn't help things. Sybil attacking the IP address
space is pretty easy in comparison to aquiring hashing power sufficient
to create false confirmations, so any attacker able to do the former
will likely be running the full node you're connecting too anyway.
Ultimately, Hearn-style SPV is a close approximation to just trusting
anyone with a non-trivial amount of hashing power. (and getting that is
surprisingly easy, e.g. w/ SPV mining)

From the point of view of full node or miner, having your peers be
valiating nodes is at best just a bandwidth optimization; all you need
from the rest of the P2P network is flood-fill capability with
reasonable DoS resistance. This isn't a problem that strongly requires
validation, and if bandwidth needs started to get excessive, sharding
the flood-fill network to limit bandwidth of any one flood-fill peer
would be relatively easy.


2) The best incentive to validate is clear and immediate failure when you don't

Currently the game theory and attacks possible against non-validating
nodes is a very complex landscape, full of cases where small attacks are
infeasible, but larger attacks possible. In particular, in many cases
you have co-ordination problems, where an attack is only viable if you
can steal at least a block reward worth of Bitcoins to make up for your
opportunity cost. This risks lulling people into complacency as attacks
seem rare, even if the risk is still quite high as the few attacks that
will happen will be very high impact.

If the system as a whole made small-scale attacks easier, we wouldn't
see this complacency, and people would build stronger systems. A
concrete example is Gregory Maxwell's idea of having all blocks commit
to two separate merkle trees, one valid and one invalid. Determining
which was which would require active validation, and because the block
as a whole is still valid regardless, this gives the opportunity to run
constant "fire drills" to uncover flaws in validation. Notable, this
scheme would even be compatible with SPV clients provided that all
sources of invalidity can be proven with a compact fraud proof.

A more extreme version of this notion is my embedded consensus ideas,
where you rely on the PoW for only proof-of-publication and/or
anti-replay functionality. Determining if coins (or any other asset) are
real becomes a clear job of validating history yourself, and/or trusting
others to do that validation. For instance, my smartcolors colored-coin
protocol work implemented client-side validation of colored coins, with
a planned (but not fully implemented - client ran out of funds)
optimization/trust tradeoff of having the issuer periodically sign
merkle-trees committing to all valid proofs within the system on an
offline machine.

Bitcoin Core doesnt have to do this. It is rational if you have >25% of
hash power (or if you believe 25% of hash power is doing this) to do this.
If a 75% hardfork target is reached, and >25% of the hashpower doesnt
allow the hardfork, and the hardfork is strictly more permissive than
the original (ie it is essentially a reverse softfork - there are no
previously valid blocks which are not still valid), then the miners who
voted for the fork would be constantly generating blocks which are
soft-forked-out by the >25% and non-supporting miners.
I believe this was pointed out to the Bitcoin XT folks weeks ago, but
apparently did not sway the decision to use 75% and a (as far as I can
tell?) strictly more permissive hardfork.

Can you explain how the spv node fails against an attacker with a
non-trivial amount of hash power where a full node doesn't? To attack an
spv wallet that is waiting for 6 or 10 confirmations, you would not only
need to Sybil them but also summon a massive amount of hashing power to
create a chain of headers (while forgoing the opportunity to mine valid
blocks with that hash power).

But could someone with that much hash power not Sybil a full node and give
them a chain for valid blocks (but on an orphan fork)? The failure model
doesn't seem specific to spv to me.

While Peter Todd's public mention on social media was likely meant to be
disparaging, I'll take the contribution of adding 'data mining' to the
title in future updates of the draft - thank you.

It might be ironic that he posted the remark on Twitter, where his message
will be aggregated and sold by twitter to data miners.

Twitter made $48m last year from selling data to data miners, at a 95%
growth rate on year-on-year basis. It has since spent $130m on buying a
data mining business who specialise in understanding how to mine data in
order to grow this part of their business. It is one of their more
profitable sideshows.

Hi Chris, I don't speak for Peter, but here's my opinion on the matter
anyway.

With SPV, it is possible to create a transaction that spends from
non-existent coins. With sufficient hashpower, you can construct an SPV
proof which sends 1,000 bitcoin to the victim. The attack is
"overloadable" in the sense that the attacker is never out of money
(they never needed to have 1,000 BTC in the first place). Whereas if the
victim is running a full node, the attacker must be signing and spending
real outputs in their control, there is a possibility in a re-org that
the victim will eventually get their money if it gets re-orged back.

On a more fundamental level, the SPV attack isn't on re-orging real/live
transactions, it's an attack on *how much money you currently have*. If
the client is using SPV, they never had the money in the first place
when attacked, irrespective of re-orgs.

It is possible to attack thousands of people at once (everyone gets
1,000 bitcoin in false transactions) with a fraction of the hashpower
(lie in wait until you get a sufficiently long chain of blocks). If you
wished to attack a full-node, it requires you orphaning a chain of valid
blocks *live*, meaning you have to send real coins in a real transaction
to the victim first. With SPV validation, you only need to construct a
chain of invalid blocks off the current blockheight *whenever*. This
means you can attack with substantially less hashpower; you don't need
51% of the hashpower to attack SPV wallets. It may be economically
unviable to attack a single victim with a full node within a very short
timeframe, but it can be economically viable to attack thousands of
victims doing SPV validation in a long timeframe.

Note I'm not arguing that SPV should be compeletely avoided, I don't
have a solid opinion on that (and some threats can definitely be
mitigated in various ways, and I certainly like/appreciate the
convenience of SPV), but the current SPV security model is definitely
weaker than running a full node (if you're handling a lot of money, you
should be running a full node), are these issues not well-known by all
in the bitcoin community?

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP: Using Median time-past as endpoint for locktime
	calculations
Message-ID: <55D288C2.9020207@gmail.com>


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Hi all,

In collaboration with Mark Friedenbach, we have drawn up a proposal for
using
the median time of the past 11 blocks in locktime calculations.

<pre>
  BIP: XX
  Title: Median time-past as endpoint for lock-time calculations
  Author: Thomas Kerin <me at thomaskerin.io>
          Mark Friedenbach <mark at friedenbach.org>    
  Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2015-08-10
</pre>


==Abstract==

This BIP is a proposal to redefine the semantics used in determining a
time-locked transaction's eligibility for inclusion in a block. The
median of the last 11 blocks is used instead of the block's timestamp,
ensuring that it increases monotonically with each block.


==Motivation==

At present, transactions are excluded from inclusion in a block if the
present time or block height is less than or equal to that specified
in the locktime. Since the consensus rules do not mandate strict
ordering of block timestamps, this has the unfortunate outcome of
creating a perverse incentive for miners to lie about the time of
their blocks in order to collect more fees by including transactions
that by wall clock determination have not yet matured.

This BIP proposes comparing the locktime against the median of the
past 11 block's timestamps, rather than the timestamp of the block
including the transaction. Existing consensus rules guarantee this
value to monotonically advance, thereby removing the capability for
miners to claim more transaction fees by lying about the timestamps of
their block.

This proposal seeks to ensure reliable behaviour in locktime calculations as
required by BIP65, BIP68, and BIPXX (OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY).


==Specification==

The values for transaction locktime remain unchanged. The difference is
only in
the calculation determining whether a transaction can be included.
Instead of
an unreliable timestamp, the following function is used to determine the
current
block time for the purpose of checking lock-time constraints:

    enum { nMedianTimeSpan=11 };
    
    int64_t GetMedianTimePast(const CBlockIndex* pindex)
    {
        int64_t pmedian[nMedianTimeSpan];
        int64_t* pbegin = &pmedian[nMedianTimeSpan];
        int64_t* pend = &pmedian[nMedianTimeSpan];
        for (int i = 0; i < nMedianTimeSpan && pindex; i++, pindex =
pindex->pprev)
             *(--pbegin) = pindex->GetBlockTime();
        std::sort(pbegin, pend);
        return pbegin[(pend - pbegin)/2];
    }

Lock-time constraints are checked by the consensus method IsFinalTx(),
or LockTime() under BIP68. These methods take the block time as one
parameter. This BIP proposes that after activation calls to
IsFinalTx() or LockTime() within consensus code use the return value
of `GetMedianTimePast(pindexPrev)` instead.

A reference implementation of this proposal is provided in the
following git repository:

https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/tree/medianpasttimelock


==Deployment==

We reuse the double-threshold switchover mechanism from BIPs 34 and 66,
with the
same thresholds, but for block.nVersion = 4. The new rules are in effect for
every block (at height H) with nVersion = 4 and at least 750 out of 1000
blocks
preceding it (with heights H-1000...H-1) also have nVersion = 4.
Furthermore,
when 950 out of the 1000 blocks preceding a block do have nVersion = 4,
nVersion = 3 blocks become invalid, and all further blocks enforce the
new rules.

It is recommended that this soft-fork deployment trigger include other
related
proposals for improving Bitcoin's lock-time capabilities, such as BIP
65, BIP68
and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.


==Acknowledgements==

Mark Friedenbach for designing and authoring the reference
implementation of this BIP.

Thomas Kerin authored this BIP document.


==Compatibility==

Transactions generated using time-based lock-time will take
approximately an hour longer to confirm than would be expected under
the old rules. This is not known to introduce any compatibility
concerns with existing protocols.

Three things:

1) Hostility is generally the result of perceived hostility.  If you assume
the best intentions of another person, you will eventually find yourself in
one of two places.  Either you will find truth with that person (becuase
they are also seeking it), or you will drive them away (because you will
ask questions that can't be answered by someone trying to deceive).

2) The Wiki says "The current Core developers are Wladimir J. van der Laan,
Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Gregory Maxwell, and Pieter Wuille."  I've
seen no hostility from any of these people.

3) The people who are threatened by Bitcoin aren't stupid enough to ignore
#1.  Can anyone imagine that they have not hired highly skilled
psychological warfare agnts to do everything they can to "help" assault
what we decentralization enthusiasts have been working for?

About #2: I'm actually blind to hostility, and that is an intentional
affectation in response to my recognition of #1 and #3 together.  If you
feel another person has expressed a bad idea, just ignore it.  If you feel
they might be misleading others, post a reply about what you know to clear
up any possible misconceptions.  There is no point in identifying
individuals who are being hostile, or pointing out hostility, or being
divisive.  Let the rest of us recognize it on our own.  Maybe send
something like what I'm writing now.

PS: If anyone is interested in conspiracy theories, I had written this into
my gmail compose window and (presumably) hit a wrong key which caused the
thread to be marked as spam and deleted my whole reply.  It hadn't even
saved a draft.  I've never seen gmail not save a draft before.

Back to the list (from github) in case anyone finds this via Google.

The patch that I posted here a few days ago did not fix the issue for Tamas.

I spent some time tracking down this edge-case because
libbitcoinconsensus needs to be as bullet-proof as possible. Thanks to
Tamas for creating a bare-bones test case after some discussion.

I finally managed to reproduce the issue on OSX. It's subtle and
likely rare in the real-world, though obviously not impossible given
the report here. For posterity, here's a rundown (braindump) of the
issue.

When calling EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name(), openssl internally checks to
see how to setup the curve's EC_METHOD (simple, montgomery, or nist).

Unfortunately, in all released OpenSSL versions (as far as I can tell
master is the only branch that has fixed this issue), it's tested like
so:

- Try a method. If it fails, set a global error and return.
- If the global error is set, try a different method.

Prior to OpenSSL 1.0.0, these were tested in the order:
EC_GFp_nist_method -> EC_GFp_mont_method. The secp256k1 curve fails
the ec_GFp_nist_group_set_curve test and sets the global error. That
error is then checked for failure, and EC_GFp_mont_method is tried
(and succeeds).

Obviously that global error usage is dangerous, especially since it
happens for _each_ transaction verification in libbitcoinconsensus. In
a multi-threaded environment, a crash is guaranteed within a few
seconds.

However, OpenSSL 1.0.1 reversed the order, trying EC_GFp_mont_method
first, so that the global error doesn't end up being used:
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/17674bfdf75bffa4e225f8328b9d42cb74504005

This was backported from master back to 1.0.1, but not to 1.0.0 or 0.9.8.

So that change (accidentally) "solved" the problem. As you can see,
it's still possible to hit the reversed order in the
!defined(OPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT) case. That's easily tested by building
OpenSSL with the -no-asm config option. It's probably also the case
for obscure architectures and OSs, but I haven't looked deeply into
that. In that case, it's reasonable to assume that this crash would
likely occur on such platforms.

Also, OSX, even the latest version (10.10 as of now), still ships with
OpenSSL 0.9.8. Which is how Tamas ran into it.

Since Bitcoin Core and libbitcoinconsensus are switching away from
OpenSSL for verification in the near future, I don't think this is
much of an issue. Especially since the problem manifests as a
controlled assertion failure/abort. However, I've prepared a patch for
anyone who may run into the issue in the short-term:
https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/adf0a691ee1c2f02e26828f976cfe5b78896b507

I'll open a pull-request for Bitcoin Core to discuss whether it's
worth merging or not.

Regards,
Cory

Dave,

? ? highly skilled psychological warfare agents ..?

Paranoia, much? 

Or perhaps the ?enemies" of Bitcoin are just sitting patiently, waiting for
it to collapse in time due to its internal contradictions.

I actually learned something important and infulential in my thinking
from the post. So I am happy it happened regardless of the other
things around it.  Because of the _very_ poor SNR on the list right
now I'm not sure if I would have seen it if it were sent by JoeBob.
(This is a greater issue, and I'm not suggesting that people start
posting with fake identities to get over the noise floor... but I'm
just presenting the facts of it as I see them here).

The rest of the traffic, not so useful, thank heavens for threaded

check out the #1 podcast in higher education on podomatic.com, you may find
that it's more awareness than paranoia.  There are other resources too,
like GnosticMedia, SchoolSucksProject, and Corbett Report.  These programs
are not addressing bitcoin specifically or even generally.  They simply
show that people with high intelligence do not always have the best
interests of the rest of their species in mind when they engineer
solutions.  For example, taxation is a form of parasitic human cannibalism,
not in the eating of flesh, but in the consuming of life force.  The
methods of farming humans to tolerate such a system are quite advanced.
Learning is the answer.  Defend yourself for the sake of everyone else.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Simplifying the blocksize limit debate
Message-ID: <CAAUq486afiWsDzMhGsYmX3v5AsWmaHNq9taS-azUodg5cWWRKA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm going to list a few assumtions / observations / understandings around
this debate. Please point out the incorrect ones.

* Most developers here agree that 1 MB is not a magic constant and that the
limit has to increase eventually.

* Most developers want to reduce the amount of policy decisions
bitcoin-core makes as much as possible.

* The most conservative option for the 4 billion dollar system that is
bitcoin is to keep the limit.

* Technological growth in bandwidth, cpu and storage exists and relative to
that growth, the blocksize limit is effectively decreased. Keeping the
limit as it is today, or was five years ago, means we need to adjust for
technological growth.

* Doing so will not reduce current decentralization, however measured.

* Increasing the blocksize limit will always require a hard-fork.
Decreasing, or stopping the growth of the blocksize limit will always be
possible via soft-fork.

* Problems arising from underestimating the need for a larger blocksize
limit are increasingly harder to fix. Problems arising from a limit that is
getting too high are more easy to fix.

* This means we can be optimistic when estimating future technological
growth.

I honestly don't understand your position, but I get the sense that you are
suggesting Satoshi wouldn't be welcome to return if he wanted to be active
in development again?

Eric,

>FWIW...

These are all good points and I agree with most of them. Yes, the block size debate is a lucky historical accident, which makes it easier for XT to pull off the split, but that's not the point.

The point is, the split _must_ happen because the centralized governance of Bitcoin became a bigger problem than the risks of a fork or larger blocks.

You cannot govern a decentralized currency with a centralized entity.

That's why we shouldn't fear hard forks - they are the new reality, and if we cannot set up a reliable process for them to happen then there _is_ no decentralized Bitcoin and we all might as well just give up and go home.

----

And that's why it would be nice to have a more complex voting mechanism in the block header (see this proposal for the new header format, for example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1151698) and other initiatives to make forking more reliable and user choice easier.

This is a better path than trying to suppress all forks by dictatorship methods of the few currently in power.

Message-ID: <d17549688c0c747b2077c1f6f96b6445@xbt.hk>

As I understand, there is already a consensus among core dev that block 
size should/could be raised. The remaining questions are how, when, how 
much, and how fast. These are the questions for the coming Bitcoin 
Scalability Workshops but immediate consensus in these issues are not 
guaranteed.

Could we just stop the debate for a moment, and agree to a scheduled 
experimental hardfork?

Objectives (by order of importance):

1. The most important objective is to show the world that reaching 
consensus for a Bitcoin hardfork is possible. If we could have a 
successful one, we would have more in the future

2. With a slight increase in block size, to collect data for future 
hardforks

3. To slightly relieve the pressure of full block, without minimal 
adverse effects on network performance

With the objectives 1 and 2 in mind, this is to NOT intended to be a 
kick-the-can-down-the-road solution. The third objective is more like a 
side effect of this experiment.


Proposal (parameters in ** are my recommendations but negotiable):

1. Today, we all agree that some kind of block size hardfork will happen 
on t1=*1 June 2016*

2. If no other consensus could be reached before t2=*1 Feb 2016*, we 
will adopt the backup plan

3. The backup plan is: t3=*30 days* after m=*80%* of miner approval, but 
not before t1=*1 June 2016*, the block size is increased to s=*1.5MB*

4. If the backup plan is adopted, we all agree that a better solution 
should be found before t4=*31 Dec 2017*.

Rationale:

t1 = 1 June 2016 is chosen to make sure everyone have enough time to 
prepare for a hardfork. Although we do not know what actually will 
happen but we know something must happen around that moment.

t2 = 1 Feb 2016 is chosen to allow 5 more months of negotiations (and 2 
months after the workshops). If it is successful, we don't need to 
activate the backup plan

t3 = 30 days is chosen to make sure every full nodes have enough time to 
upgrade after the actual hardfork date is confirmed

t4 = 31 Dec 2017 is chosen, with 1.5 year of data and further debate, 
hopefully we would find a better solution. It is important to 
acknowledge that the backup plan is not a final solution

m = 80%: We don't want a very small portion of miners to have the power 
to veto a hardfork, while it is important to make sure the new fork is 
secured by enough mining power. 80% is just a compromise.

s = 1.5MB. As the 1MB cap was set 5 years ago, there is no doubt that 
all types of technology has since improved by >50%. I don't mind making 
it a bit smaller but in that case not much valuable data could be 
gathered and the second objective of this experiment may not be 
archived.

--------------------

If the community as a whole could agree with this experimental hardfork, 
we could announce the plan on bitcoin.org and start coding of the patch 
immediately. At the same time, exploration for a better solution 
continues. If no further consensus could be reached, a new version of 
Bitcoin Core with the patch will be released on or before 1 Feb 2016 and 
everyone will be asked to upgrade immediately.

Thanks a lot Cory for following through the test case and producing a patch.

I confirm that libconsensus is now running stable within the Bits of Proof stack,
in-line with test cases we use to verify the java implementation of the script engine,
that are BTW borrowed from Bitcoin Core.

The performance of libconsensus is surprisingly close to the java one.
Validating a 2-of-2 a multi-sig  transaction runs at 1021 ops/sec with java and 1135 ops/sec
in libconsensus. This is on a 2.2GH i7 laptop (4 hyper threading cores used by 8 threads).
Another nice demonstration why one should not trade in advances
of languages for the last decades for a marginal gain of performance with C/C++,
I assume thereby that Bouncy Castle? EC lib s not superior to OpenSSL's.

I disagree that the problem was rare in the real-world, it should affect any modern
implementation that validates transactions parallel in multiple threads.

Aborting also does not make the problem less severe in my opinion.
Therefore hope the pull will be included into Core with next release.

I can?t assign a timeline to ?near future" secp256k1 integration. Can you?

My interpretation is that he's saying Satoshi wouldn't be welcome to return
as Satoshi, because whatever he did/said would inevitably end up being
treated with authority, which shouldn't be the case.

A smaller block size would make this a soft fork, as unupgraded nodes would
consider the new blocks valid. It would only make things that were allowed
forbidden, which is the definition of a soft fork. For a hard fork, you
need to allow something that was previously invalid.

Message-ID: <CAED3CWgTOMFgaM6bBfU0Dn-R0NrdrhGAQo34wHEneYkTtB4Opg@mail.gmail.com>

Regarding:
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010295.html


I am arguing with the following statement here...

*I see problems to this approach. The biggest one I see is that a miner
> with 11% of hash power could sabotage block size increases by only ever
> mining empty blocks.*



First, I would like to argue from economics' point of view. If someone
wants to hold back the block size increase with 11% hash power by mining
empty blocks, he has to sacrifice Tx fees, which is not economical. 11%
hash power will most likely be a pool and pool miners will find out soon
that they are losing Tx fees because of pool owner's intention. Hence,
they'll switch pool and pool owner will lose out. This is the same reason
why 51% attack will never happen, even if a pool gets more than 51% hash
power.


Next, I would like to propose a slightly modified technical solution to
this problem in algorithmic format...

If more than 50% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the last
difficulty period, is more than 90% MaxBlockSize
         Double MaxBlockSize
Else if more than 90% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the last
difficulty period, is less than 50% MaxBlockSize
         Half MaxBlockSize
Else
         Keep the same MaxBlockSize

This is how, those who want to stop increase, need to have more than 50%
hash power. Those who want to stop decrease, need to have more than 10%
hash power, but must mine more than 50% of MaxBlockSize in all blocks. In
this approach, not only miners, but also the end user have their say.
Because, end users will fill up the mempool, from where miners will take Tx
to fill up the blocks. Please note that, taking first 2000 of the last 2016
blocks is important to avoid data discrepancy among different nodes due to
orphan blocks. It is assumed that a chain can not be orphaned after having
16 confirmation.

Looking for comments.

A few points there. First, Core is switching to libsecp256k1 for
several reasons, and one of them is speed. I seem to recall it being
up to 8x faster than OpenSSL.

Also, it can depend heavily on compiler switches and optimization
levels. For example, In playing with my test-case for hitting the
OpenSSL race issue, I managed to get a ~100% speedup by simply using
-O3 and lto.

Well I'd say you're a bit biased in this case ;)

It's only those using ancient (0.98 or 1.00) versions of OpenSSL who
are affected, or those with OPENSSL_BN_ASM_MONT support disabled or
missing. Note that official releases of libbitcoinconsensus are
compiled against a much newer version and shouldn't have any issues.

The earlier patches for locking callbacks should be unnecessary.

> Aborting also does not make the problem less severe in my opinion.

Well it's not a good thing by any means, but it's certainly better
than incorrect results! In any undefined/error condition for the
consensus library, aborting is the right thing to do. If we can't
explain how we've reached a certain "unreachable" condition as is the
case here, the only reasonable recourse is to shut down. Otherwise we
risk network forks, DOS, etc.

It will likely be unnecessary for the next release, but I do think
it's worth backporting to the 0.10 and 0.9 series.

> I can?t assign a timeline to ?near future" secp256k1 integration. Can you?

I believe the libsecp256k1 guys are generally happy with the lib these
days, but I'll avoid guessing at a timeline. We can discuss that on
the PR for this fix, which I'll do today.

I'm no authority on the subject, but I don't understand why there is a max
block-size, other than anti-spam measures.

The only other reason I have heard for a max-block-size is to force people
into paying higher fees.

This seems like the wrong way to force fees.  If you want to force fees,
then do exactly that - make fees required, and set a minimum... don't force
people to pay fees by limiting transactions per second.  That's like
shooting yourself in the foot to get free surgery....

I?m 100% in favor of attempting a hard fork using a far less controversial, far less risky consensus rule change. We should stop wasting our energy arguing over stuff we don?t really know and understand and can?t predict very well - and we should especially avoid using a highly contentious change as our first hard fork deployment.

I?m also in favor of trying a small block increase before attempting any major jumps. I don?t think we should be focusing so much on long-term block size adjustment rules right now - much more critical is to develop a hard fork mechanism and to make sure we can deploy it. So something along these lines is probably a step in the right direction.

Who am I? Personally I have zero objection if the creator steps in. I
think he would be highly welcome by the most people. At first I had the
impression that the email was a fake, but maybe I was wrong. At the
moment I think: Maybe it's even the best if we do not know exactly
whether it was Satoshi or not.

Unanimity is mission critical for Bitcoin and must be an absolute
priority. If not the vast majority is in favor for a fork, then the fork
should be avoided until a consensus is found. Even if it takes until the
cows come home.

But it is very likely now that it will come to a fork. No matter which
site will win, this will produce a lot of humiliated people at the end.
That's not good and leads to bitterness on both sites.

Sounds like a much better approach than arbitrary deciding what the 
block size should be

Deploying experimental code onto the "live" bitcoin blockchain seems
unnecessarily risky.  Why not deploy a blocksize limit experiment for long
term trials using testnet instead?

Problem is if you know most of the people running the testnet personally (as is pretty much the case with many current testnets) then the deployment amounts to ?hey guys, let?s install the new version?

I like the simplicity of this approach.  Demand driven response.

Is there really a need to reduce the max block size at all?  It is just a
maximum limit, not a required size for every block.  If a seasonal
transaction surge bumps the max block size limit up a notch, what harm is
there in leaving the max block size limit at the "high water mark"
indefinitely, even though periods of decreased transaction volume?

I'd argue to remove the reduction step, making the max block size
calculation a monotonic increasing function. Cut the complexity in half.

And this is how the powers that be compromise bitcoin. They can't stop
TCP/IP, but they sure can take over the development team. It's a good thing
that no one from the CIA has had any conversations with anyone from the
bitcoin development team. Phew...

Ya, so?  All that means is that the experiment might reach the hard fork
tipping point faster than mainnet would. Verifying that the network can
handle such transitions, and how larger blocks affect the network, is the
point of testing.

And when I refer to testnet, I mean the public global testnet blockchain,
not in-house isolated networks like testnet-in-a-box.

I agree with the simplicity of this approach and with removing the
reduction step... it's unlikely the block size would ever need to be
reduced, only increased with demand?

I like this solution better than either kicking the can, or raising the
block size based on chain height (another dynamic solution).

People have already been testing big blocks on testnets.

The biggest problem here isn?t whether we can test the code in a fairly sterile environment. The biggest problem is convincing enough people to switch without:

1) Pissing off the other side enough to the point where regardless of who wins the other side refuses to cooperate
2) Screwing up the incentive model, allowing people to sabotage the process somehow
3) Setting a precedent enabling hostile entities to destroy the network from within in the future
etc?

These kinds of things seem very hard to test on a testnet.

Again, I'm not suggesting further testing in sterile environments.  I'm
suggesting testing on the public global testnet network, so that real-world
hazards such as network lag, bandwidth constraints, traffic bottlenecks,
etc can wreak what havoc they can on the proposed implementation.  Also, a
test deployment would give more people an opportunity to see how the
proposed implementation works and "kick the tires", which might help to
reduce some degree of angst about the proposals.

Your point appears to be that the biggest challenge facing Bitcoin is not
technical, but political. Sadly, you may be right.

If performance was the only trade-off with Java, and if C++ was frozen
in time, I would say you have a point.

Thanks for submitting, and Cory, thanks for working this out.

-> You need to take into account the reward halving, likely to be in
3Q2016. Forks and reward halving at the same time would possibly be a bad
combination.

-> The original proposed date for the fork was December 2015. It was pushed
back to January as December is a busy period for a lot of people and
businesses. Likewise, June is a busy period for people. July / August is a
good period as it is quiet because people go on holiday. A window of 2
months during holiday periods is better than starting in June. January 2016
is better, mainly because of the excessive reward halving chatter likely to
be going on..

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin XTs Tor IP blacklist downloading system has
 significant privacy leaks.
Message-ID: <20150818233130.7A22815F000@c-in3ws--03-03.sv2.lotuslive.com>

Bitcoin XT contains an unmentioned addition which periodically downloads
lists of Tor IP addresses for blacklisting, this has considerable privacy
implications for hapless users which are being prompted to use the
software. The feature is not clearly described, is enabled by default,
and has a switch name which intentionally downplays what it is doing
(disableipprio). Furthermore these claimed anti-DoS measures are
trivially bypassed and so offer absolutely no protection whatsoever.

Connections are made over clearnet even when using a proxy or
onlynet=tor, which leaks connections on the P2P network with the real
location of the node. Knowledge of this traffic along with uptime metrics
from bitnodes.io can allow observers to easily correlate the location and

This should probably be posted on the BitcoinXT mailing-list, as Bitcoin
Core does not currently include this feature.

IIRC Gregory Maxwell came up with the actual idea in question, during a
discussion between myself and Luke-Jr about incentives related to nTime
on #bitcoin-dev or #bitcoin-wizards. He should get credit for it; I'll
see if I can dig up a link to the discussion for historical interest.

Just to add some superfluous and unessential spice to this discussion,
there were two Satoshi users originally registered in sourceforge, one
registered very soon after the other. So I say Satoshi were at least two
people, so it may be the case that one Satoshi re-appeared, but the other
did not.

Ore maybe one Satoshi is for Bitcoin XT, and the other Satoshi is against
it.

Satoshi wars!

So I checked, and the code described *does not* run when behind a
proxy of any kind, including tor:

https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/commit/73c9efe74c5cc8faea9c2b2c785a2f5b68aa4c23#diff-11780fa178b655146cb414161c635219R265

At least based on my admittedly weak understanding of how the internal works.

Hopefully I save the next reader of your post from also having to dig
around to find the code and realize this is a false alert.

That's not entirely correct.

The code does disable downloading of the Tor exit node list if fListen
is false, or if there is a proxy setup, this means the statement:

>  Connections are made over clearnet even when using a proxy or
>  onlynet=tor,

is false. However, in the common scenario of a firewalled node, where
the operator has neglected to explicitly set -listen=0, the code does
still download the Tor exit node list, revealing the true location of
the node. This is contrary to the previous behavior of not revealing any
IP information in that configuration.

FWIW Gregory Maxwell removed the last "call home" feature in pull-req
#5161, by replacing the previous calls to getmyip.com-type services with
a local peer request. Similarly the DNS seeds use the DNS protocol
specifically to avoid leaking IP address information.

tl;dr: Yes, Bitcoin XT has a privacy problem with the automatic Tor exit
node list download.

It's not a bug, it's a feature: These concerns and others were
specifically called out when we rejected this submission to Bitcoin
Core in favor of a more generic approach that lacks the privacy
problems and avoids being explicitly punitave to the use of Tor.

At least it's not a full on block as soon a the node fills for the
first time like the first implementation.

Oh, and I just checked, and Mike's original pull-req for the Tor
blacklist didn't include the proxy disable code; what's in master != the
pull-req, so the OP may have been looking at the wrong code by accident.
(I personally noticed this issue in the pull-req and didn't realise it
hadn't been merged into master w/o modifications)

https://github.com/mikehearn/bitcoinxt/commit/931a4d59a03c7e64d7d85ddfc07ae127533c7f28#diff-11780fa178b655146cb414161c635219R171

Kinda sloppy of Mike to be making changes in master that don't
correspond to the peer-reviewed pull-req code...

The "XT Fork" (better said, a POS alt*) and those behind it make not
even a pretense to work through process involved with bitcoin developmen
t.

(*This is not intended as a slight toward any other alts, as here in
this post I am focusing solely on XT.)

Instead of abandoning their useless project, or at least conceding
that their alt is operating essentially outside of the development
funnel (by this I mean BIP process), the developers of XT, via their
latest presentation of XT give nothing more than an attack on bitcoin
(albeit one that, more than anything, is designed to sidetrack real
discussion necessary to resolve the issues so as to achieve some level
of consensus in block size debates).  Curiously, XT is not even truly
the implementation of BIP 101; the actual proposed implementation of
BIP 101 as proposed at
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki#implement
ation
is found here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6341
(It is currently a closed issue.)

It's probably valid to call into question why Mike Hearn in particular
persists with this project at all, as he has been its biggest
cheerleader. Some reasons may be:
1) His interest in attacking bitcoin in the past (seems to be a
recurring pattern)
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=333824.0

2) His employment (has come up before) - QinetiQ, Google, etc
https://plus.google.com/+MikeHearn/about - it's simply not
unreasonable to ask why he's pushing it so hard when nobody wants it.

3) Various reasons mentioned here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/39yaug/the_history_of_mike_hea
rn_and_why_you_should_not/


4) His disinterest in following what is actually happening with votes
on legitimate proposals (e.g. Garzik's BIP 100) in the blocks. (Caveat
~ one doesn't see the BIP 100 yet in bitcoin/bips because it won't
appear for another couple weeks, supposedly.  The miners' voting is
already happening however.) Even according to http://xtnodes.com/ we
see that XT runs minimal nodes in comparison to the rest of nodes
being run across the network.

BIP 100 itself is anticipated to be submitted w/ implementation in the
next 2 weeks and many miners are already voting on BIP 100 (as per
Jeff Garzik, from a post 08/12/2015 12:46 PM -0400 to this mailing list)
.

 It is an insult to see Hearn fling the XT turd into the community
repeatedly.

How then to end this XT madness?

"How then to end this XT madness?"

Instead of bashing on someone that has actually put a solution forward,
make your own fork and see if your ideas on how to solve the issue are any
better.

As of now, 1Mb blocks are pure madness, and people are voting over an 8mb
block increase every day that passes, even with a "useless project" like
you call it.

Go out there and see how bitcoin is actually used.

Tier ~

I don't think the XT author(s) are going to do what you are
describing.  Their recent release, at
https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt/blob/0.11A/README.md
doesn't show any sign of moving toward a version which would be
"increasing consensus." Instead, they ignore any meaningful process
and, as I have recently indicated, have created somthing which
"sidetrack(s) real discussion necessary to resolve the issues so as to
achieve some level of consensus in block size debates."

That doesn't rule out that the BIP authors can't work together and
create something meaningful and useful, though.  As I stated before,

"In my past message(s), I've suggested that Jeff's BIP 100
is a better alternative to Gavin's proposal(s), but that I didn't
think that this should be taken to mean that I am saying one thing is
"superior" to Gavin's work, rather, I emphasized that Gavin work with
Jeff and Adam."

I am also looking forward to seeing some visualizations or graphs of
the miner votes going on right now on BIP 100 and BIP 101, for example.

Regarding XT, my statement is simple:

"Do not download this loathsome XT thing. Cast it back into the fires
from whence it came."

 BIPs on this website ?
Message-ID: <CA+1nnrk1EWd7rhwj91p1rqgGVFgOT4UYq=+Nmq41sHJYmy7YYA@mail.gmail.com>

I created a small website which show a chart of your approvals about
various BIPs (which you must fill by yourself with a signed pgp message)

For each BIP, you can fill if you approve or not, and give comments. (HTML
accepted, so you can link stuff you your posts)

It would help the community a lot, so I hope you will do it !
I'm open to add other important devs, big miners, or other proposal that I
missed.

Please, respond on BTC Talk or github. (I don't read the mailing anymore
because of the spam :( )

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] CLTV/CSV/etc. deployment considerations due to
 XT/Not-BitcoinXT miners
Message-ID: <20150819055036.GA19595@muck>

Deployment of the proposed CLTV, CSV, etc. soft-forks has been recently
complicated by the existence of XT(1) and Not-Bitcoin-XT(2) miners. Both
mine blocks with nVersion=0x20000007, which would falsely trigger the
previously suggested implementation using the IsSuperMajority()
mechanism and nVersion=4 blocks. Additionally while the
XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT software claims to support Wuille/Todd/Maxwell's
nVersion soft-fork mechanism(3) a key component of it - fork
deadlines(3) - is not implemented.


XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT behavior
--------------------------

Both implementations produce blocks with nVersion=0x20000007,
or in binary: 0b001...111

Neither implementation supports a fork deadline; both Not-Bitcoin-XT and
XT will produce blocks with those bits set indefinitely under any
circumstance, with the proviso that while XT has a hashing power
majority, blocks it produces might not be part of the Bitcoin blockchain
after Jan 11th 2016. (though this can flap back and forth if reorgs
happen)

Curiously the BIP101 draft was changed(4) at the last minute from using
the nVersion bits compliant 0x20000004 block nVersion, to using two more
bits unnecessarily. The rational for doing this is unknown; the git
commit message associated with the change suggested "compatibility
concerns", but what the concerns actually were isn't specified. Equally
even though implementing the fork deadline would be very each in the XT
implementation, this was not done. (the XT codebase has had almost no
peer review)


Options for CLTV/CSV/etc. deployment
------------------------------------

1) Plain IsSuperMajority() with nVersion=4

This option can be ruled out immediately due to the high risk of
premature triggering, without genuine 95% miner support.


2) nVersion mask, with IsSuperMajority()

In this option the nVersion bits set by XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT miners would
be masked away, prior to applying standard IsSuperMajority() logic:

    block.nVersion & ~0x20000007

This means that CLTV/CSV/etc. miners running Bitcoin Core would create
blocks with nVersion=8, 0b1000. From the perspective of the
CLTV/CSV/etc.  IsSuperMajority() test, XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT miners would be
advertising blocks that do not trigger the soft-fork.

For the perpose of soft-fork warnings, the highest known version can
remain nVersion=8, which is triggered by both XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT blocks
as well as a future nVersion bits implementation. Equally,
XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT soft-fork warnings will be triggered, by having an
unknown bit set.

When nVersion bits is implemented by the Bitcoin protocol, the plan of
setting the high bits to 0b001 still works. The three lowest bits will
be unusable for some time, but will be eventually recoverable as
XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT mining ceases.

Equally, further IsSuperMajority() softforks can be accomplished with
the same masking technique.

This option does complicate the XT-coin protocol implementation in the
future. But that's their problem, and anyway, the maintainers
(Hearn/Andresen) has strenuously argued(5) against the use of soft-forks
and/or appear to be in favor of a more centralized mandatory update
schedule.(6)


3) Full nVersion bits implementation

The most complex option would be to deploy via full nVersion bits
implementation using flag bit #4 to trigger the fork. Compliant miners
would advertise 0x20000008 initially, followed by 0x20000000 once the
fork had triggered. The lowest three bits would be unusable for forks
for some time, although they could be eventually recovered as
XT/Not-Bitcoin-XT mining ceases.

The main disadvantage of this option is high initial complexity - the
reason why IsSuperMajority() was suggested for CLTV/CSV in the first
place. That said, much of the code required has been implemented in XT
for the BIP101 hard-fork logic, although as mentioned above, the code
has had very little peer review.

We can use nVersion & 0x8 to signal support, while keeping the consensus
rule as nVersion >= 4, right? That way we don't waste a bit after this all
clears up.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Ensuring Users have Safe Software and Version
Message-ID: <55D426A4.3070006@riseup.net>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


Recently I was re-reading the following (which has been edited
periodically):

https://bitcoin.org/en/alerts

It currently reads, "There is no ongoing event on the Bitcoin network."

However, in reading the most recent alert on that page, we are (it
seems) still affected by the issues discussed relative to the 4th of
July event, namely:

https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2015-07-04-spv-mining

This originally was formulated in alerts via discussion on bitcoin.org
repository, here:
https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/933

So anyway.

Getting back to this, how do I ensure that I have a safe version?

Thus far I am still using the guidance here from the bitcoin.org alert
shown above.  For example, for Electrum, bitcoin.org not only directs
users to wait 30 confirmations more than usual, but also directs users
to the following resource:
https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=July_2015_chain_forks&redirect=n
o

This brings me to the "safe software and version."  If we understand
this correctly, the safe software and version will be Bitcoin Core at
its most current version.  Thus it is vitally important to provide a
way to ensure that users do not inadvertently be misled into
connecting to a XT node.

However, the information (about the software and version, in banner)
is provided voluntarily by the server administrators and thus isn't
validated.  How to make sure that you are actually connecting to one
who is running Core with the proper version (and not Core with some
very old version, or XT)?

On the bitcoin wiki, it states in part,
"During a fork, it is possible to use the Get Block Header custom
plugin[3] to authoritatively determine which side of the fork an
Electrum server is on."  It refers to this:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1110912.msg11800126

Depending on what wallet people are using, that is, Core, any of the
other wallets... hardware, desktop, web, mobile... there would be
different ways to determine what software is being used to make sure
that you are using Core in the current version (and not inadvertently
using XT for example).  The question is, how would this be done most
easily?

Thanks in advance for your answer(s).

I see no problem with Satoshi returning to participate in peer review.
Bitcoin development has long since migrated from a single authority figure
to a system of technical peer review consensus. What is more of a problem
is this list has degenerated to a generalised discussion forum where any
academic or technical debate is drowned out by noise.

I joined this list so I keep be abreast of bitcoin's technical development
and proposals. I am sure many ecosystem stakeholders and participants also
once used this list to keep abreast of technical developments and academic
research. It would be splendid indeed if we could return to some semblance
of decorum that once existed.

Do you think we could have a "bitcoin-discuss" list where specifically
non-technical discussion can happen leaving this list for more academic and
technical debate together with setting a clear mandate about what is on
topic for this list?

Apparently that existed already: http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/
But technical people run away from noise while non-technical people
chase them wherever their voices sounds more loud.

One thing that I would like though, is separating Bitcoin
Core-specific development from general bips and consensus discussions.
I know, the bitcoin-consensus mailing list will probably still be
noisy, but at least we will have a non-noisy one and the ability to
say things like "Bitcoin Core's default policy is off-topic in
bitcoin-consensus" in the noisy one...
Also developers of alternative implementations may not be interested
in Bitcoin Core-specific things, so they may want to subscribe to
bitcoin-consensus and unsubscribe from bitcoin-dev.

I already told this to some people and everybody seemed to be positive
about this change, at most sometimes skeptics about the potential
benefits.

Thoughts?

Apart from classifying all potential consensus rule changes and
recommend a deployment path for each case, deploying an
uncontroversial hardfork is one of the main goals of bip99:
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-July/009837.html

The uncontroversial hardfork doesn't need to change the maximum block
size: there's plenty of hardfork proposals out there, some of them
very well tested (like the proposed hardfork in bip99).

I disagree with this. I think it should be schedule at least a year
after it is deployed in the newest versions.
Maybe there's something special about June 2016 that I'm missing.

I would expect any uncontroversial hardfork to be deployed in testnet3
before it is deployed in bitcoin's main chain.

In any case, you can already do these tests using
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6382
Note that even if the new testchains are regtest-like (ie cheap proof
of work) you don't need to test them "in-a-box": you can run them from
many different places.
Rusty's test ( http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=509 ) could have been
perfectly made using #6382, it just didn't existed at the time.

Seems like 3 is something we want to do no matter what and therefore
is the "most future-proof" solution.
I wonder if I can help with that (and I know there's more people that
would be interested).
Where's the current "non-full" nVersion bits implementation?
Why implement a "non-full" version instead of going with the full
implementation directly?

Nobody has complained about Bitcoin-XT (nor libbitcoin, nor libcoin,
nor against any other of the multiple alternative implementations of
bitcoin).
Please, understand that people are worried about the schism hardfork,
not about the software fork (which happened long ago when some of
Hearn's changes were reverted due to security concerns). If Bitcoin-XT
didn't had a schism hardfork, nobody would be calling it "an altcoin".
For consensus rules we use "the implementation is the specification"
as a principle for multiple reasons. By separating libconsensus (a
work in progress [far less progress than I would like]) we remove
Bitcoin Core's privileged position: Bitcoin Core wouldn't be "the
specification of the consensus rules" anymore, just a reference
implementation that is not "consensus-safer" compared to alternative
implementations (since they can use libconsensus directly [or a
software fork of it in the case of a reasonable schism hardfork]).

> That's why we shouldn't fear hard forks - they are the new reality, and if we cannot set up a reliable process for them to happen then there _is_ no decentralized Bitcoin and we all might as well just give up and go home.

We have many reasons to fear schism hardforks (
https://github.com/jtimon/bips/blob/bip-forks/bip-0099.mediawiki#Schism1_hardforks
), even though they may be unavoidable at some point (ie for an
ASIC-reset hardfork).

Regarding disruptors, if there are clear rules about what is acceptable on
-dev, one can simply moderate out offenders. It's absolutely necessary we
have a forum where we can share and discuss purely academic and technical
matters. No-one can accuse censorship because all moderation would say
would be to "take it to the other list". It's essential for all people who
are developing and maintaining Bitcoin protocol software, or services that
rely on it. The mailing list used to be very low volume.

While we are at it, we should also think about a bitcoin-announce read only
list which consumers of Bitcoin Core can subscribe for announcements about
new versions of Bitcoin Core, and any critical warnings. Miners and service
providers would particularly benefit from this. The list is moderated so
only say Bitcoin Core commit engineers are allowed to post.

The potential downside is too much separation becomes confusing although I
would not oppose such a change. My own suggestion would be try just a -dev
and -discuss list and see how that goes first. It used to work well.
Whatever the case I am very confident we need a general discussion mailing
list.

Some XTBTC advocates may sell all their BTC for XTBTC and viceversa.
But I'm afraid that what most currency speculators (thus most Bitcoin
holders) will do is just sell both all their BTC and XTBTC for fiat,
and wait for things to settle before deciding whether to re-enter or
not.
This could result in both currencies' prices going down to 1 usd cent,
nobody knows.

> I cannot see how Bitcoin XT is but-not in a extremely weak position from

Unfortunately it also puts Bitcoin core in an extremely weaker
position than it was before the Schism hardfork.
Even if XT fails in making blocks bigger, it may destroy Bitcoin.
That's probably not the goal of Bitcoin XT, but I don't think Andresen
and Hearn fully undesrtand the risks of a Schism hardfork (not to
mention their "followers" in the interwebs).

Since we want to discard the assumption that Hearn and Andresen want
to make Bitcoin centralized or destroy it, it's reasonable to conclude
that have serious misunderstandings on how the global consensus works.
This is consistent with some of their strong positions on Bitcoin Core
policy defaults (like maintaining the first seen spending-conflict
replacement policy [the dumbest possible one after "last seen"]
forever).

Yes, it seems the simplest way to permanently separate your BTC from
your XTBTC is to move them all in transactions bigger than 1MB. You
may need too many outputs to increase the size (thus also hurting the
utxo size in Bitcoin XT), but that's just a side effect.

Firstly, XT is controversial, not uncontroversial;
Second, this issue has been beat to death quite a while ago
https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/899#issuecomment-117
815987
Third, it poses major risks as a non-peer reviewed alt with a number
of problematic features (with the privacy problems recently mentioned
on this list being just one of them)
Fourth, it has not followed any semblance of process in terms of the
development funnel or BIPS process, with XT developers instead
choosing instead a dangerous path of hard forking bitcoin while being
well aware of miner voting on viable solutions which have followed
process.

The following proposals
http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/
regardless of what you think of any one of them, are deserving of
attention (BIP 100 / BIP 101) and are being voted on as you read this
by miners. (BIP sipa is not yet numbered, and BIP 102 is a backup
/fallback option.)  BIP 100 is probably the best of these (note, in
part, it schedules a hardfork on testnet in September).

Contentious hard forks are bad for Bitcoin.

You may want to read this again if you haven't recently.

There is no basis for further promoting XT by suggesting that it

There is a simple answer to this, convenience: versionbits has not been
implemented yet, and I believe the BIP is still in review stage. As it
seems likely the remaining locktime pull requests will be ready by or
before the next major release, we need a deployment method if versionbits
is not ready (which is unlikely because no-one appears to be working on it
at the moment). Pieter indicated he is OK with another IsSuperMajority()
rollout in the interim. Personally, I dont think we should let perfection
be the enemy of progress here because at the end of the day, the deployment
method is less important than the actual featureset being proposed.

That said, the features in the next soft fork proposal are all related and
best deployed as one featureset softfork, but moving forward, versionbits
seems essential to be able to roll out multiple features in parallel
without waiting for activation and enforcement each time.

I don't disagree with anything you have said. But I think that having
a list specific to Bitcoin Core development will make defining the
"clear rules" easier.

You misunderstand my intention. The experiment is not about a random 
hardfork. It's about a block size increase hardfork. The data will help 
us to design further hardfork on block size.

To make it less controversial, the size must not be too big.

To allow a meaningful experiment, the size must not be too small. 
Technically we could make it 1.01MB but that defeats all objectives I 
listed and there is no point to do it.

That's why I suggest 1.5MB.

I hope the fork could be done before the halving, which (hopefully) we 
may have a new bitcoin rush

There was only 2 months for the BIP50 hardfork. You may argue that's a 
"bug fix" but practically there is no difference: people not fixing the 
bug in 2 months was forked off. Four months of grace period (Feb to June 
2016) is already a double of that.

Also, if we could have zero grace period for softfork, why must we have 
a ultra-long period for hardfork? (Unless you also agree to have an 
1-year grace period for softfork. I don't buy the "softfork is safer 
than hardfork" theory. The recent BIP66 fork has clearly shown why it is 
wrong: non-upgrading full nodes are not full nodes)

The problem is many people won't update until they must do so. So 4 
months or 1 year make little difference

One of your goals is "show the world that reaching consensus for a
Bitcoin hardfork is possible", right?
BIP99 can achieve that goal without touching the block size (thus
probably less controversial).

The data can be collected using testchains. See #6382

That makes the data less interesting, doesn't it?

It wouldn't defeat the "show the world that reaching consensus for a
Bitcoin hardfork is possible" objective though. But again, we don't
need to touch the block size to achieve that goal.

> That's why I suggest 1.5MB.

But that wouldn't be uncontroversial (unless it was accompanied with
data that somehow quantifies the risks, in which case maybe another
bigger size is acceptable).

Yes, emergency hardforks are a different case as explained in BIP99's draft.
In any case, " we all agree that some kind of block size hardfork will
happen on June 2016" it's clearly false since I can find many
counter-examples besides myself.

I don't think giving 1 year for "everybody in the world" to upgrade is
an "ultra-long" period.
I'm proposing 5 years for the hardfork proposed in bip99.
I do think softforks are safer than hardforks, that doesn't mean
softforks don't have serious risks as well.

I disagree with this conclusion as well (it doesn't follow from the
first sentence, non sequitur).

XT it's just a software fork.
BIP101 (as currently implemented in Bitcoin XT) is a Schism hardfork
(or an altcoin), but BIP101 could be modified to be deployed like an
uncontroversial hardfork (in current bip99's draft, a given height
plus 95% mining upgrade confirmation after that).

I'm not defending the Schism hardfork being proposed. I am very
worried about it and I have publicly said so several times.
If Bitcoin XT didn't contained the Schism bip101 hardfork I wouldn't
be so worried: users are free to use software that is less reviewed at
their own risk.

It's users and not miners who decide the consensus rules.

You may want to read BIP99 to understand that I know this, but still
think that Schism hardforks may be necessary in some situations (I
don't think this one is reasonable though).

All I'm saying is that Bitcoin XT the software fork is totally fine
(like other alternative Bitcoin implementations). The big problem is
BIP101 being deployed as a Schism hardfork.

Bitcoin is imploding due to a failure of consensus. There has been a

This is the root cause of the disagreement. Not on what value the block
size should be set to, a symptom and red herring. The whole argument
against a block size increase is the further reduction in the node count.

Therefore it makes sense to focus all energies on solving the root cause if
we are to save Bitcoin in the short and long run. It is tempting to toy
with the idea that a superior cryptocurrency which fixes the flaws can
supplant Bitcoin while it dies, but there is significant merit in the
suspicion that if Bitcoin fails the whole idea of cryptocurrencies will die
with it for another generation.

Below I will outline my thoughts on how Bitcoin can be improved so that
more people will be incentivised to run nodes.

1. The current incentive is run like a lottery.

Mining becomes more and more of a lottery the more value that Bitcoin
acquires. Prudent and rational people don't partake in lotteries as the
expected payoff is negative. Due to rewards at the block level, this leads
to a winner-takes-all situation, which leads to centralisation.

2. Decentralised proof-of-work is equivalent to value.

bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org> wrote:

Proof-of-work is the basis of Bitcoin's security, which contributes to
Bitcoin's value. Further, the more decentralised that proof-of-work is, the
greater the value proposition of Bitcoin as a currency resistant to change
by coercion.

3. Importance of a public technical forum.

In order for there to be consensus, there must be a triumph of ideas over
people. Ideas are immortal, people are not. Also, pragmatism over idealism.
There must be no rank within the community, and no censorship or ignorance
of others no matter their past contributions. However, it stands to reason
that those who are more educated and experienced should be taken more
seriously than those who are not.

4. Stronger ties between transaction validation and proof-of-work.

As pointed out, mining in the pooled sense can be done without doing any
validation whatsoever. By tying mining with transaction validation, the two
must become inseparable.

The logical conclusion of this is that instead of mining blocks per se,
transactions must be mined individually.

5. Fees to be paid to nodes.

The incentive to run nodes shall be made monetary. All the reward is
currently going to those who do not really support the network.

50% of a transaction's fee should go to the node that mined the transaction.

6. The timechain.

Currently it is difficult to envisage anything other than grouping
transactions into blocks and timestamping them. The POW timestamping
service must have sufficient time gap between blocks.

Therefore as transactions are mined each one will have the possibility to
become a block in the timechain. The POW difficulty for a block will
obviously be much greater than the POW required to mine a single
transaction.

This also requires every mined transaction to contain a block header, in
case it becomes a new block in the block chain. It will contain a prev
block hash, a merkle tree of mined transactions in the mempool, a nonce and
two separate coinbase addresses. One coinbase output will be used to pay
the miner of the transaction, and the other will also pay the miner the
(50%) transaction fees of the other transactions in the block, if the POW
on the transaction also satisfies the POW difficulty of a block.

7. Transaction POW difficulty.

Block POW difficulty can remain as it currently does, to produce blocks at
approximately 10 minute intervals.

Transaction POW difficulty affects the rate at which mined transactions are
produced.

Now, since each transaction contains a prev block hash an important
decision to make is whether to mandate that all transactions within a block
contain the same prev block hash, and that the prev block so referenced is
the immediate previous ancestor block, or whether any transaction may be
admitted into a block so long as the prev block referenced by the
transaction is any previous ancestor in the main chain.

If the former, then any transactions which don't make it into a block must
be re-mined for inclusion in the next block. Hence this more closely
enforces the rate at which transactions are mined and included.

The rate at which transactions are mined and included in blocks is
obviously proportional to the block size. The transaction POW difficulty
can be adjusted periodically so that the transaction rate or block size
follows a smooth trajectory and does not make any sudden jumps.

Greater decentralisation of POW leads to increased mined transaction rate
(given sufficient unmined transaction rate production). The inverse is also
true. Hence transaction rate and block size is proportional to degree of
decentralisation.

8. Miscalleneous observations.

Nodes only need work on transactions if they are valid.

Mined transactions are a weak guarantee that they will be accepted by the
network.

The originator of a transaction may self-mine his own transaction to avoid
paying some of the fee.

Transactions with higher fees and smaller size will be mined in preference.

Large block spam attack is expensive due to the POW needed to mine the
gigantic number of transactions.

Decentralisation of nodes is encouraged to be close to the location of real
transaction origination i.e. consumers. Unmined transactions may not be
relayed by a node if it chooses to work on it, if the fee is high enough.

Block-level reward is still a decentralised lottery. Transaction-level
rewards go to those running the network. Fees will go up as it will be the
nodes that are mining transactions that need to be individually
compensated, and not miners mining only block headers.

You must be really tired.

Please read the whole pull request discussing this loathsome subject her
e:

https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/899

It was fairly detailed and conclusive. I'm not being a dumdum when I
say that it is controversial.

Everybody here is well aware of what this sad proposal is.  See
detailed reply to the moaning and groaning of Hearn on this subject,
where he claimed that "the difference between hard and soft forks is
actually quite small, has got smaller with time and is thus hardly the
policy-founding chasm you seem to think it is."  He was wrong, of
course.  Thus, my reply to that, which I won't bother to quote in
detail but which you can read here:

Given the state in which bitcoin is in now, one could say that things
are fairly horrible, but by no means necessitating, as you put it, a
schism hardfork.  It is clear and evidenced by my previous posts and
others that Hearn's efforts are an attack on the bitcoin network.

It's not totally fine at all.  It shouldn't even exist.  People are
doing other unsuspecting users a disservice by even suggesting that it
should be downloaded.

 The big problem is

This is certainly a problem.

The proof is in the validation of transactions. How can a node
reliably validate transactions unless it has the past history of
transactions? Entire blockchain not required or necessary, but that's
a plus.

If operating as an SPV node then it can check the transactions by querying
other nodes.

On an unrelated note, it sounds like your proposal will significantly
increase the data size of every transaction, which will create even more
contention for block space.

SPV is for checking validity of transactions that have already entered
the blockchain, as I understand it. My proposal requires nodes to
validate transactions that are unconfirmed, and to commit to the
validation by doing a POW on it.

If we stipulate that the coinbase fields only hold space for a single
pubkey, then the entire block header including the two coinbases
should only take an extra 100 bytes or so. Transactions are already
routinely 250 bytes+. So an increase of roughly 33%.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core versus XT observations
Message-ID: <CAKujSOHGPTy-A3TUKKxO4kJYhWaReqyni2aE0CvK0ON8tixNNw@mail.gmail.com>

1.) Most people are running XT as a vote for bigger blocks and not because
they specifically support BIP101. If Core supported bigger blocks, most XT
users would switch back to Core and XT would die.

2.) In this high stakes game of poker, XT just went all in, but Core still
has the far better hand. There are many, many scaling solutions Core could
adopt that would appease XT users enough to kill XT. Don't let perfect be
the enemy of good. The real question is whether or not anyone can provide
enough Core leadership to reach "consensus". The longer it takes for Core
to reach "consensus", the stronger XT gets.

3.) Bitcoin market price has a far greater mining centralizing effect than
larger blocks ever will. Right now, miners with reasonably efficient
hardware and energy costs (.5W/GH mining hardware, 10 cents per kilowatt
hour power, $250 BTC price) spend about half of their mining income on
electricity. If the total Bitcoin market cap is under ~5 billion at the
next halving in July 2016, it's game over for all but the most efficient
(large) miners. The mining centralization that may occur with 8MB blocks in
2016 is nothing compared to the centralization that will occur if the total
Bitcoin market cap does not grow substantially between now and the next
halving.

4.) Investors hate uncertainty, and the blocksize issue is adding a lot of
uncertainty right now, which makes the mining nightmare scenario outlined
above more likely. The entire ecosystem needs time to adjust and grow once
a Core scaling solution is adopted. Hopefully this issue will be revolved
well before the next halving in July 2016 so the market has time to adjust
and grow again.

5.) Not-BitcoinXT is a really terrible idea. Mike has proven time and time
again that he will not blink or back down. The chances of Not-BitcoinXT
gaining 25% of the hashrate are pretty much nil, so in effect, all
Not-BitcoinXT will do is help XT reach the 75% threshold sooner and end up
putting more people on the losing side of the fork.

Wait, why did Bitcoin-XT use that nVersion???

Definitely option 3 is much cleaner technically, and it would be nice to have that code implemented, but I'd be rather concerned about the size of the fork ballooning. It's already four separate features in one fork, which seems pretty big, even if the code isn't too huge. I'd probably prefer slightly to waste another two version bits than add a bunch of code to the fork now (maybe we can take just a part of the bit-based approach and allow lower version numbers again after the fork reaches 95%?). Either way, a proper version of the bit-based soft forking mechanism should be implemented sooner rather than later (maybe merged unused, even).

Still, it is entirely possible that there is relatively little uptake on XT and a competing proposal has a lot of support before we want to ship a LTV fork, so it may all be moot (or we could choose option 1 to fix the XT fork for them - easily forking off XT miners when either fork happens so XT isn't vulnerable to the 25% attack without needing to mine a massive transaction on Bitcoin first :p).

If you're running an SPV node that is listening to full nodes on the
network, you can request an unconfirmed transaction from connected peers
after receiving the inventory message they send - that's how unconfirmed
transactions propagate through the node network. This is not 100% proof
that the transaction is valid for inclusion in the blockchain, but it's a
very good indicator.

It seems laborious to enumerate all the validations that are performed
on a transaction before it can be mined into a block, but for starters
we need to check it isn't a double-spend, and that its signatures
satisfy the outputs' pubkeys.

If you as an SPV node are waiting for unconfirmed transactions to be
relayed to you, you are going to have a slow start in mining those
transactions, decreasing the likelihood of receiving the mining
reward. Nodes should accept the first POW for a transaction and
discard any subsequent ones received.

That is true VC investors and people starting companies.  People who 
invest directly in Bitcoin love all this stuff.

A few weeks back a bunch of stories quoting nonsense spouted by Bitcoin 
cultists that Greece can use Bitcoin now as a replacement currency and 
store of value.  The price went about $300 so I sold a bunch of my 
coins.  Now we have these stories that Bitcoin is splitting in 2 and it 
went down to near $200 so I bought them back.

The point is that "developer attacks" have to be taken into 
consideration when discussing these things.

What problem am I missing if we just mask of the offending bits. For my own
project which uses auxpow (and thus has weird nVersion), I also used the
bitmasking method to get rid of auxpow version bits before making the
standard integer comparisons to deploy BIP66 using IsSuperMajority():

    if ((block.nVersion & 0xff) >= 4 && CBlockIndex::IsSuperMajority(...))

What happens if XT gets 40% and this BIP gets 55%?  That gives 95% that
accept the upgrade.  Version 3 and lower blocks need to be rejected after
that.

By advertising 0x7 for the last 3 bits, XT is effectively claiming to
support the check locktime verify BIPs but they don't have the code.

This sequence could be used, without a specific version-bits proposal.

Until height = N + 5000, if 950 of the last 1000 blocks have the 0x8 bit
set, then reject blocks with version numbers less than 8.

At height N, if the above rule is active, then the BIP is permanent.

It applies to any block with bit 0x8 set, once the 75% threshold is met.

>From height N + 5000 to N + 10000, reject blocks which have bit 0x8 set.

N could be set 1 year from now, or so.


This gives a period of time after lock that bit 8 is kept and then a period
where is is guaranteed to be zero.

This gives software that is only watching the bit time to be upgraded and
similarly time where the bit is set to zero before it can be reused.

What if version number 257 is used in the future?  That would appear to be
a version 1 block and fail the test.

A lot of this detail and worry is eliminated by simply asking BIP 102
maintainers to change to a different bit that works best for everyone.
Existing nVersion garbage will get buried in sufficient time window to
prevent anything from triggering.

Just settle on a specific standard, reserve bits for feature upgrade forks,
and move on.  There is already a rough standard proposed in sipa's gist.

bitcoin-dev for protocol discussion and bitcoin-core for Bitcoin Core
discussion?

As Jorge notes, a general discussion list has existed for a long time with
little use.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miners are struggling with blocks far smaller

As jl2012 indicated, this is an insufficient analysis.

You cannot assume that because X time passed since the last block, the
miner's internal block maker has updated the template, and from there, is
shipped out to the hashers in the field.  Further, even if you update the
block template at time Y, a hasher might return with a solution for the
block at time X, and the miner will of course publish solution X.

There are several steps of latency involved, even ignoring things such as
the miner relay network or getting US pool stratum links to a sub-pool in
China.

No, BitcoinXT won't become a Schism hardfork, or may be just for a few 
days, at most.

There is one, and only one scenario that BitcoinXT will win: it is 
supported by major exchanges, merchants, and investors, and they request 
miners to support it. When BIP101 is activated, these exchanges will 
refuse to accept or exchange tokens from the old chain. Miners in the 
old chain can't sell their newly generated coins and can't pay the 
electricity bill. They will soon realize that they are mining fool's 
gold and will be forced to switch to the new chain or sell their ASIC. 
The old chain will be abandoned and has no hope to revive without a 
hardfork to decrease the difficulty. The dust will settle in days if not 
hours.

Will the adoption of BitcoinXT lead by miners? No, it won't. Actually, 
Chinese miners who control 60% of the network has already said that they 
would not adopt XT. So they must not be the leader in this revolution. 
Again, miners need to make sure they could sell their bitcoin in a good 
price, and that's not possible without support of exchanges and 
investors.

What about that Not-Bitcoin-XT? The creator of the spoof client may stay 
anonymous, but the miners cannot. 95% of the blocks come from known 
entities and they have to be responsible to their actions. And again, 
they have real money in stake. If bitcoin is destroyed, their ASIC 
serves at best as very inefficient heaters.

So Bitcoin-XT is basically in a win-all-or-lose-all position. It all 
relies on one condition: the support of major exchanges, merchants, and 
investors. Their consensus is what really matters. With their consensus, 
that could not be a Schism hardfork. Without their consensus, nothing 
will happen.

-------

Or let me analyse in a different angle. BitcoinXT is in no way similar 
to your examples of Schism hardforks. All of your examples, "ASIC-reset 
hardfork", "Anti-Block-creator hardfork", and "Anti-cabal hardfork", are 
hostile to the current biggest miners and will destroy their investment. 
These miners have no choice but stick to the original protocol so 2 
chains MUST coexist. However, BIP101 has no such effect at all and 
miners may freely switch between the forks. They will always choose the 
most valuable fork, so only one fork will survive.

And I'm not trying to be a dumdum (whatever that is) when saying that
Bitcoin XT the softfork and BIP101 implemented as a schism hardfork in
Bitcoin XT are different things. One existed before the other. And if
there wasn't a schism hardfork in the making there wouldn't be any
warning about Bitcoin XT in bitcoin.org because Bitcoin XT implemented
the same consensus rules (and I think was largely ignored).
When we say "Bitcoin XT is bad" some users read "Bitcoin Core devs
think any code fork to Bitcoin Core is back because they lose control
over it".
The second is not the case: nobody complained or cared about Bitcoin
XT when it implemented the same consensus rules.

I'm not sure I will learn anything by reading this link (I didn't
reading the previous link).
Have you read BIP99 already? Can you tell me where you disagree with
what's in BIP99 in one of its 2 threads?

Again, I'm against this Schism hardfork but maybe I'm in favor of an
Schism hardfork in the future, I don't know.
We're both against the Schism hardfork but somehow you think I'm in
favor and are trying to change my mind.
What are we even discussing about?

Right now it shouldn't be downloaded because it contains this quite
irrational Schism hardfork.
When it was only a not-up-to-date-bitcoin/master + the commits
(non-consensus changes) Hearn would like to see in Bitcoin Core nobody
was specially worried about it.

Hello Jorge, Eric,

With all this noise on the -dev mail list I had to implement application
level filters so I can treat with priority posts from certain people,
you are on that list. While I agree with your arguments, I think it is
_very_ important to highlight some things. I am neither for the
blocksize increase neither against it, because plain and simple I don't
have enough arguments to take some definitive decision on this topic.
What I am angry about is spreading FUD that a fork could kill Bitcoin
and what we are experiencing now is somehow terrible.

1. Bitcoin XT is not necessarily an attack over Bitcoin and will not
split it into 2 different coins. It is the result of an open source free
system which lacks centralization. It is just at early stage, it could
have thousands for forks (or fork attempts) during its life.

2. We have no proof that Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen are trying to do
something bad to Bitcoin. So far everything they have done is (or should
be) allowed. They have forked an open source software and implemented a
voting system for a consensus rule change - doesn't sound like they are
committing a crime here (either legally or morally). If they are
qualified enough to maintain the software, or if the decision is
technically correct or not is another story, and it should only matter
to whoever uses / wants to use -XT.

3. If Bitcoin's value can be decreased (or Bitcoin as a project killed)
just by 2 people forking the software and submitting a consensus rule to
a vote, it means Bitcoin is dead already and it should be worthless! We
can't go around and panic every time somebody forks Bitcoin and tries to
change something - this should be allowed by the nature of its license.
If tomorrow 5 more people fork 5 different software implementing the
bitcoin protocol and submit 5 different new consensus rules to a vote,
then what? We should all sell so the price will drop to 1 cent, because
it is somehow not good enough, not stable enough?

I can fork tomorrow Bitcoin Core to a Bitcoin-XYZ software which at some
block in the future spends all the longest dusted coins to me, out of
which I give away 50% to the miners (so the hashing power will have
incentive to use my fork).

Can they do it? YES
Will they do it? NO
Should the world care about this? NO

It's as simple as that. We cannot continue to panic that "Bitcoin as a
project" is at threat because somebody forked it.

4. By having a software fork and consensus rule submitted to vote we
actually prove how open Bitcoin is, and how there is lack of control
over it from all parties (developers, miners, engineers on the mail
list). This is reason to increase Bitcoin's value! It is a feature, not
a flaw!


It's very important for everyone in the ecosystem to understand:

- yes, Bitcoin is open source, even you can fork it tomorrow if you want
and you think enough users might follow you.

- no, it's not a requirement for 100% of the nodes in the network to be
running Core, or -XT or other implementation. The more we have, the better.

- yes, there is absolutely no authority in Bitcoin - this is what lead
to this dispute in the first place. This is the truly decentralized
nature of the software, not important if we have 10.000 full nodes or
1000 full nodes.

- no, Bitcoin won't split / die or whatever because of this fork.
Regardless what it happens, if XT will reach the threshold or not,
Bitcoin will go on just because it has some unique advantages and has no
competitor from some points of view.

- Bitcoin by its design has many many advantages, but also the
limitation that it relies on majority being honest / doing the right
thing! This is just the way it is, and the benefits it is offering
heavily win over this fundamental limitation.

The code was peer reviewed, in the XT project. I didn't bother submitting
other revisions to Core, obviously, as it was already rejected.

The quantity of incorrect statements in this thread is quite ridiculous.

So, the exchanges get together to "encourage" the miners to start running
bitcoin-XT.  What would they do?

One scheme would be to create a taint system.  All non-XT coinbases outputs
are marked as tainted.  All outputs are tainted if any of the inputs into a
transaction are tainted.  Tainted coins can only be un-tainted by sending
0.5% of their value to the public address of one of the participating
exchanges (or to OP_RETURN).  They could slowly ratchet up the surcharge.

Exchanges in the cartel agree not to exchange tainted coins.  Even if some
still do, the tainted coins are still inherently less valuable, since fewer
exchanges accept them.

Schemes like that are the main way for non-miners to flex their muscles,
even if they seem unsavory.

Taint tracking would allow merchants to participate.  They could give less
credit for tainted bitcoins, even if the exchanges are trying to remain
neutral.  If that happens, the exchanges could run 2 prices, BTC and
BTC-tainted.

On the other hand, implementing taint machinery is a bad thing for
fungibility.

It can also be accomplished with checkpointing.  They need to create 1 big
block and then agree to checkpoint it.

A less strict rule rule could be that blocks after the first big block
count as double POW.  That means that the big block chain only needs 34% of
the hashing power to win.

I am indifferent on this issue (the bit inversion), but so far only Jorge
has spoken up. I opted for this detail during implementation in order to
preserve existing semantics, even if those semantics are not commonly used.
This was the conservative choice, driven in part because I didn't want the
proposal to be held up by the other side saying "this is confusing because
it changes how sequence numbers work! it used to count up but now it counts
down!"

I can see both sides and as I said I'm indifferent, so I went with the
conservative choice of not messing with existing semantics. However if
there is strong preferences from _multiple_ people on this matter it is not
too late to change. If anyone feels strongly about this, please speak up.

I think you misunderstand my suggestion Tier. I am suggesting the same as
BtcDrak, I think:

Modify IsSuperMajority to take an (optional) mask field. Bits set in that
mask are zero'd for the purpose of the IsSuperMajority calculation. For
this vote we mask bits 0x20000007.

Thus to signal support for CLTV/CSV/etc. (on Core, XT, or not-XT), you set
bit 4. On Core this would mean a minimum version of 0x8, on XT/not-XT a
minimum version of 0x20000008.

However the vote is still over whether to enforce BIP 65, 68, etc. for
blocks with nVersion>=4. So when this all clears up we haven't needlessly
wasted an additional bit.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin XT Fork
Message-ID: <CALqxMTFkgGx0FxMiZ77inOZSs_+TQ88Wpj-q-c12COkO9tP4gQ@mail.gmail.com>

It seems to be a recurring meme that BIP 101 is somehow "a solution
put forward" where BIP 100, 102, 103, flexcap, extension blocks etc
etc are not.

That is not at ALL the case, and is insulting (present company excluded).

It is just that no one else is reckless enough to bypass the review
process and risk a controversial hard fork deployment war.  Myself and
many other people warned Gavin a network fork "war" would start (ie
someone would think of some way to sabotage or attack the deployment
of Bitcoin-XT via protocol, code, policy, consensus soft-fork etc.  He
ignored the warnings.  Many also warned that 75% was an optimally BAD
trigger ratio (and that in a hard fork it is not a miner vote really
as in soft-forks).  Gavin & Mike ignored that warning to.  I know they
heard those warnings because I told them 1:1 in person or via email
and had on going conversations.  Others did too.

People can not blame bitcoin core or me, that this then predictably
happened exactly as we said it would - it was completely obvious and
predictable.

In fact noBitcoinXT is even more dangerous and therefore amplified in
effect in creating mutual assured destruction kind of risk profile
than the loose spectrum of technical counters imagined.  I did not
personally put much effort into thinking about counters because I
though it counter productive and hoped that Gavin & Mike would have
the maturity to not start down such a path.

Again any of the other proposals can easily be implemented.  They
*could* also spin up a web page and put up binaries, however no one
else was crazy enough to try to start a deployment in that way.

It is also puzzling timing - with all these BIPs and ongoing
discussion and workshops coming imminently to then release ahead of
that process where as far as I know Gavin said he was equally happy
with BIP 100 or other proposal which ever is best, and on basically
the eve of workshops planned to progress this collaboratively.
Bitcoin-XT is also under tested, people are finding privacy bugs and
other issues.  (Not even mentioning the above 75% optimally bad
parameter, and the damage to community reputation and collaborative
environment that this all causes.)

Very disappointing Gavin and Mike.

I find it quite notable that Gavin and Mike have been radio silent on
the bitcoin-dev list and yet we see a stream of media articles, blog
posts, pod casts, and from what I can tell ongoing backroom lobbying
of companies to run bitcoin-XT without trying AT ALL to offer a
neutral or balanced or multi proposal information package so that
companies technical people can make a balanced informed decision.
That is what the workshops are trying to provide.

Gavin, Mike - anything to say here?

If 25% or more of the hashpower are against XT, Not-BitcoinXT becomes an
important weapon for them. This was not a "bad idea", but can shake the
market.

I think, keeping the reduction part is necessary to have it demand driven.
Otherwise, we could just increase it to a fixed size. If the max cap is
high, but there is not enough Tx in the mempool, then after one big block
many will go small. This will not be good when block reward become small
and mining revenue become dependent on Tx fee. But, if reduction is there,
max cap will come down soon and all miners will see revenue from Tx fee
again.

To clarify this is the code example for how the same problem occurs
with auxpow bits when running a an IsSuperMajority() softfork and how
it's solved in that instance.

In our case for Bitcoin Core, option 2 we use nVersion=8, apply a
bitmask of 0xdffffff8 thus:

    if ((block.nVersion & ~0x20000007) >= 4 &&
CBlockIndex::IsSuperMajority(...)) { //...}

With nVersion=8, but using comparison >=4 allows us to recover the
bit later, assuming we want it (otherwise we use version >=8).

This should, unless I am missing something, be forward compatible with
future softforks. My understanding was if "versionbits softfork" code
is not ready by the time we're ready for the deployment,
IsSuperMajority() would be acceptable; and this is how we could deploy
it in the wake of the XT developers' carelessness.

I think calling it "miner vote" was the first mistake: miner's
shouldn't have a "voting power" the rest of the users lack.
I prefer to call it "miner upgrade confirmation" and in BIP99 the
recommendation is to use 95% for both uncontroversial softforks and
uncontroversial hardforks (the uncontroversial harforks also have a
minimum height before starting the miner confirmation/voting to give
users additional time to upgrade).
To me it's no different that the mechanism is used for uncontroversial
softforks or hardforks, the main question is that it is NOT a "miners'
democracy/oligopoly".
If you expect everyone (including all miners) to upgrade, I don't
think any less than 95% makes sense. On the other hand, 100% makes it
relatively cheap for an attacker to block uncontroversial consensus
changes.

For a Schism hardfork, bip99 doesn't recommend to use miner's
confirmation/vote at all. Miners could be against the change, for
example in an ASIC-reset Schism hardfork or in a "hardfork" (it cannot
be a softfork if miners oppose to it) to reduce the block size), but
that shouldn't stop the hardforkers if they think dividing the
currency in 2 is the best solution to whatever is the problem at hand
(which I don't think it's the case now).

Of course, BIP99 is still a draft and can still be changed. But I
would really like that we focused on "how to do hardforks in general"
first and only then focus on how to make a blocksize hardfork
concretely.

I saw your post about that awhile ago, thanks for doing the work!  My
fiddling with that end of the food chain is gated by my needing to block
out a weekend to set up a bitcoind build environment.

How do "big-block" testnet nodes running this 6382 rev recognize each other
on the peer network? If I set up a 2MB block limit testnet node and
-addnode another 2MB block testnet node (say, JornC's node) to it, and my
node mines a block stuffed with 1.3MB of test txs, the other "big-block"
node should accept my mined block, but it will be rejected / immediately
orphaned by the rest of the testnet network because it exceeds their notion
of block size limit, correct?

Thanks,
-Danny

I would like to add for the record, I also warned Gavin of this in his
PR to Bitcoin Core, and also suggested a timeout which if
activation/enforcement did not occur within, hard fork deployment
would be cancelled. His response was to delete these from the PR
claiming thresholds were not relevant conversation in his PR and
belonged elsewhere (even though they had already been discussed
elsewhere).

IMO that's a very reasonable request; lately I've spent a lot of time
having to educate journalists on how Bitcoin doesn't have a "chief
scientist" with any kind of authority. Having Gavin Andresen in that
position at the otherwise inactive and bankrupt Bitcoin Foundation
misleads the public about the true nature of how Bitcoin operates,
giving a misleading impression that it has the same centralized decision
making as conventional financial systems do. Among other things, this
harms the reputation of Bitcoin as a whole as it can confuse the public
into thinking there aren't major differences between Bitcoin and those
conventional financial systems.

As the email said "Regardless of your personal view on XT this is bad
for bitcoin." - a statement I agree with 100%

That is the 75% "activation" rule portion?  The 95% rule has to apply to
all blocks.

The supermajority applies to unmasked blocks?

I think you want it so that a sequence of blocks with version 8 can be
followed by version 4 blocks?

If 950 of the last 1000 blocks have bit 0x08 set, then reject any block
with a version less than 4.

This means transitioning to the version bits BIP just requires dropping the
version back to 4 and adding a rule enforcing the BIPs for version 4 and
higher blocks.

This would be part of the version bits BIP enforcement.

Normal GitHub users submitting pull-reqs to Bitcoin Core can't delete
other users' comments on their own pull-reqs...

IMO that's an abuse of the pull-req process, and in turn, Gavin
Andresens's commit access rights for the Bitcoin Core repo.

That kind of comment is perfectly on topic in the pull-req review
process; deleting it harms that process by removing useful information
about the trade-offs of the pull-req, both for people now, as well as
future efforts investigating the history of Bitcoin's protocol
development.

I think this should weigh in favor of Gavin Andresen not having commit
privileges for the Bitcoin Core repository.

I don't have the time to use the code to write tests and simulations
myself right now but I would be really happy about someone else doing
it.
Even though they share the same port and magic numbers, each of the N
testchains in #6382 has a different genesis block, so they will reject
blocks from any other testchain from the start.
But you will likely connect the nodes directly and manually to get the
network topology you want to test anyway.
I hope this answers your questions but I'm happy to answer any other
questions you may have.

I have (hopefully) answered your questions in the other thread.
Review/testing of #6235 would be also appreciated (to hopefully
eventually merge the full #6382 branch into bitcoin/master).

Well -dev or both, I dont particularly see a difference at the moment,
and establishing two lists isnt really going to make a difference so
long as Bitcoin Core is the reference client, which it is by defacto.
The risk of having too many lists is interested stakeholders will miss
a discussions. Normal protocol and core discussions are usually pretty
low volume in any case.

I would suggest it's only because there havent been any rules for -dev
that would force general discussion over to the bitcoin list. On IRC
we regularly tell people in #bitcoin-dev they are OT and ask them to
move to #bitcoin and as a result, -dev remains quite clear of chit
chat, #bitcoin has a steady stream of general chatter.

We could reduce the OT/noise of bitcoin-dev list considerably by
offloading the non-technical/academic debate to the bitcoin list. It
just needs a bit of shepherding. I am more than happy to help out.
Especially if the list already exists, we should consider making a
decision now.

Who are the moderators for that list? Do we really want to use
sourceforge or are there alternatives, like another list on
linuxfoundation?

ping @Warren.

Would you kindly link to said peer review as I was unable to find it
other than a couple of comments between you and Gavin which hardly
amounts to peer review.

Gavin has been very clear about the fact that he's on vacation. I'm not sure what you want Mike to say. It's obvious the Bitcoin Core developer pitchforks are out for him so there isn't really anything he can possibly say which will be constructively received on this highly adversarial and increasingly ridiculous charade of a mailing list. I feel as though they've made their case abundantly clear to anyone paying attention.

The community will weigh the independent merit of the two points of view and that community is not as naive and uninformed as everyone on this list likes to portray them to be. Your concern for companies' welfare is appreciated but I'm confident they can manage their own independent assessments of this matter as well as seek out enough varied expert opinions such that they can make an informed decision.

It?s good to know that Gavin still manages to keep his priorities straight. Of course, vacationing at the moment that the most controversial change in the history of Bitcoin which threatens to split the community is officially ?announced? is probably exactly what he should be doing.

I?m glad to know that we?ll continue to have this amazing leadership under the XT fork.

FYI, a few developers including Wladimir, Greg, Peter Todd, Pieter, and
Alex Morcos have been discussing what to do about improving the signal
noise ratio on bitcoin-dev list.  One proposal similar to this discussion
was to split it into multiple mailing lists.  It was pointed out that the
less technical Bitcoin discussion list already existed in the past and
nobody used it.  Generally the discussion went away from creating yet
another mailing list and toward instituting an on-topic guidelines for
bitcoin-dev.  Gavin, Wladimir, and a few of the others agreed to a simple
few paragraphs written by Alex Morcos.  IIRC Wladimir agreed to post it.
Has it been posted yet?

I agree, fwiw.  If he's going to censor others then that's
inconsistent with the responsibility of having commit access.

Unfortunately, I think that from a PR angle, removing Gavin from commit privileges right now will probably play into his hand. Sadly.

Say what you will regarding Gavin and Mike?s technical merits, they?ve been quite clever on the PR front. Framing this issue as ?obstructionism from the core devs? and relying on the fact that many people out there can?t seem to tell the difference between a source code fork and a blockchain fork.

And this is precisely why we should make perfectly clear that we're
not against a code fork where Hearn or anyone else acts as a
"benevolent dictator", just against the controversial hardfork it is
attempting to deploy.
Otherwise the PR battle is probably lost (which may mean users sell
all their BTC for XTBTC [or just forget about their BTC and only care
about their XTBTC]).

FWIW,

I would fully like to see the consensus stuff split off into a separate organization from everything else. Let XT continue to support additional p2p messages or relay policies or whatever. Let Mike and Gavin argue for their improved wallet or whatever - I have absolutely no problem with that.

But the consensus code should NOT be subject to the same commit policies?and we should make an effort to separate the two clearly. And we should find a way to communicate the difference succinctly and clearly to laypeople (which is something I think the XT opponents have been horrible at doing so far).

This is a message that I wrote and had hoped that all the core devs would
sign on to, but I failed to finish organizing it.  So I'll just say it from
myself.

There has been a valuable discussion over the last several months regarding
a hard fork with respect to block size.  However the sheer volume of email
and proportion of discussion that is more philosophical than technical has
rendered this list almost unusable for its primary purpose of technical
discussion related to Bitcoin development.  Many of us share the blame for
letting the discourse run off topic to such a degree, and we hope that an
appeal for individual self restraint will allow this list to return to a
higher signal-to-noise ratio.
-Please consider the degree to which any email you send is related to
technical development before sending it.
-Please consider how many emails you are sending to this list regarding the
same topic.
This list is not appropriate for an endless back and forth debate on the
philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin.  Although such a debate may be
worthwhile it should be taken to another forum for discussion.  Every email
you send is received by hundreds of developers who value their time as much
as you value yours.  If your intended audience isn't really the majority of
them, perhaps private communication would be more appropriate.

Thanks,

Alex,

With all due respect, right now the biggest challenge facing Bitcoin is not technical but political. I would love to see this list go back to technical discussions, but unfortunately, until this political stuff is resolved, even technical discussion is purely philosophical as there?s little chance of actually making good progress on consensus?which in a space where everything depends on consensus pretty much makes everything else moot.

Ah, I see your point now re: wasting bits; my post was a bit incorrect
on that point.

So a subtle thing with the IsSuperMajority() mechanism, and the nVersion
bits proposal alternative, is one of the main objectives of the latter
proposal proposal is to allow forks to *fail* to be adopted cleanly.

To illustrate the problem, consider a hypothetical CLTV soft-fork,
implemented with IsSuperMajority() nVersion >= 4. We release Bitcoin
Core with that code, call it Bitcoin Core v0.12.0, however some
substantial fraction of the mining community refuses to upgrade,
believing CLTV to be a bad idea. This forms the community into Bitcoin
Core and Bitcoin Not-CLTV camps. The Not-CLTV camp then wants to do a
new soft-fork upgrade, say for CHECKSIG2

What now? If CHECKSIG2 is implemented via IsSuperMajority, nVersion >=
5, that'll falsely trigger Core nodes to think the upgrade has gone
though. You could safely define >= 5 semantics to be "OP_CLTV is now
disabled", but that's pretty ugly and unnecessarily uses up a NOP.

You can avoid this problem by assigning one bit out of nVersion for
every soft-fork, but then you can only do ~29 more soft-forks - ugly!


Come to think of it, if you're Really Sure? the soft-fork will be
adopted, you can recycle those bits by using the following rule:

    if (IsFlagBitMaskSuperMajority(1 << 4, pindex->pprev) || block.nMedianTime > CLTV_SOFTFORK_DEADLINE) {
        flags |= SCRIPT_VERIFY_CLTV;
    }

IsFlagBitMaskSuperMajority() is a masked version of the existing
IsSuperMajority() logic. CLTV_SOFTFORK_DEADLINE would be set some
reasonable amount of time in the future, perhaps 3 years.

This would probably be ok for non-controversial forks - implementing
DERSIG this way would have been fine - and an unlimited number of
soft-forks can be done this way safely. (even in parallel)

However, this idea still causes problems if forks ever fail to get
adoption, something the nVersion bits proposal handles cleanly, albeit
at the cost of a significantly more complex implementation. With a
sufficiently far off fork deadline in practice that may not be a big
issue - nearly everyone would have upgraded their software anyway -  but
it's still technically creating hard-fork scenarios with respect to
older software whenever forks fail to get adoption.

Haha. Reminds me of when I asked Gavin earlier this year about whether
he cared about politics and he replied that he only cared about and
was responsible for the technicals. Little did he know he would
unwittingly become the technical enabler for Mike's political
shenanigans.

I am also indifferent, but also dislike technical debt.

It should maybe be noted for those who wish to do/write-code-for mempool
transaction selection (irrespective of one's opinion on it) that lower
is better, since transactions with shorter relative locks are
transactions with "higher priority".

That policy code should be simple to change, but thank you for pointing it out.
Also thank you for declaring your position (indifference) on the subject.

If you think developers do not talk politics go read LKML... Politics are
inevitable.
I think the "I don't know enough to code (Bitcoin) but I think that"
belongs somewhere else (This is the -dev list).

And we should find a way to communicate the difference succinctly and clearly to laypeople (which is something I think the XT opponents have been horrible at doing so far).

I think that effort is in progress (again, much slower that I would
like it to be) and it's called libconsensus.
Once we have libconsensus Bitcoin Core it's just another
implementation (even if it is the reference one) and it's not "the
specification of the consensus rules" which is a "privileged" position
that brings all sorts of misunderstandings and problems (the block
size debate is just one example).

Nelson,

Talking politics, Devs do day and night, however politics is also about
knocking on door and not sitting behind a keyboard writing a perl script to
spam the politicians with the same content. Politics is about maneuvering
to be in a position to get the elected official to do what you want because
if he don't, you will make sure it will not get elected next time.

I personally never could finish drilling into the code (which is very
elegantly written) because some New York idiot decided that Bitcoin was too
dangerous for society to handle. I had to stop playing with the code and
turn my attention elsewhere. *You can read the opinion of one of the idiot

So guys, do we need a BIP to address the existence of XT and its possible
impact to the block chain?

I think everyone is in that position (we just don't have enough data
about the proposed sizes) or it's just too optimistic.

Bitcoin XT is just a software fork and nobody seem to have a problem
with that (as repeated in other threads), people are worried about the
way bip101 is going to be attempted to be deployed using Bitcoin XT.
We already have more than 5000 software forks and that's totally fine.

A Schism fork may not kill Bitcoin but it will certainly create 2
different coins.
The claim that "there will be a winner and everybody will just move
there" is incredibly naive and uninformative.
Many people will sell their xtbtc and reject the hardfork
independently of its support by miners.
Nobody knows what the result will be, but both currencies' prices
dropping near zero is certainly a possibility that Gavin and Mike are
not aware about or are not informing their followers about.
Here's something a little bit longer about this topic:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR137
Note the last part:

"

Again, no problem with the code fork, but the Schism hardfork is very
risky regardless of their intentions.

If they don't extensively lobby Bitcoin companies, they don't start a
massive PR campaign labbeling other developers as "obstructionists"
and don't misinform a big part of the Bitcoin users (often using
logical fallacies, intentionally or not), probably those 5 new
currencies will be ignored and nothing bad will happen.
Unfortunately in this case a great division between users is being created.

Can you please stop conflating "Bitcoin Core as a project" and
"Bitcoin consensus rules".
They are different things and nobody is or can be "in charge" of the
later, face it.

Can you please also stop conflating software fork and
"Schism/controversial/contentious hardfork"? Nobody has anything
against the former and as you point out it is allowed by its free
software license.

Why should miners have a voting power that the rest of the users lack?

All this sounds reasonable.

But you cannot know this will happen this way!
If the threshold is reached (let's forget about noXT for now), the
remaining miners cannot be forced to adopt bip101.
And users can never be forced to adopt hardforks.
It is possible that 75% of the hashrate moves to the bip101 chain
while 99% of the users remain in the old Bitcoin chain. Or 50/50,
40/60...nobody knows.

No, it doesn't rely on that. It just relies on the majority of the
miners not attacking the network for too long (ie the number of
confirmations people are waiting).
If I'm running a full node, I'm not isolated from the network and the
majority of the hashrate is not reorging the chain I am safe no matter
how dishonest the "majority" (whatever that means in this context) is.

Wouldnt the experience for SPV nodes be chaotic?  If the full nodes
are 50:50 XT and bitcoin core, then SPV clients would connect at
random and because XT and core will diverge immediately after
activation.

Jorge,

I applaud your efforts and objectives WRT libconsensus independence. But
as you know I differ with you on this point:

> Once we have libconsensus Bitcoin Core it's just another
> implementation

I do not consider Bitcoin Core just another implementation as long as
libconsensus is built directly out of the bitcoind repository. It's a
finer point, but an important one. Eric makes this point emphatically as
well:

>> But the consensus code should NOT be subject to the same commit
policies...and we should make an effort to separate the two clearly.

As you have implied, it's not likely to happen in the Bitcoin Core repo.
Taking a dependency on Bitcoin Core is a metaphorical deal with the
devil from our perspective. So my question is, how do you expect other
implementations to transition off of that repository (and commit
policies)? Or do you expect the dependency to be perpetual?

In our discussion leading up to libbitcoin building libbitcoin-consensus
we disagreed on whether intentional hard forks would (or even could)
happen. I think that issue is now settled. So my question remains how do
stakeholders (users/miners) maintain consensus when it's their
individual intent (the first objective of libconsensus), and diverge
when intended (which a direct dependency on libconsensus makes harder)?
IMO it's unreasonable to operate as if this won't happen, given that it has.

There are a very small number of implementations that rely on consensus
(fewer that aren't also forks of Bitcoin Core). I think it's time we
discuss how to work together to achieve our mutual goal. I assume you
have been in contact with all of us. If you would like to facilitate
this I'd be happy to join in an offline discussion.

The potential impacts of Schism/controversial/contentious hardforks
are shortly covered in
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR137
It is still a BIP draft so improvements are welcomed.

I guess every mailing list should have its own internal SNR discussions.

My answer is to respond when something is off-topic and offer a different
place for the topic.  I haven't been doing that, partly because no one else
has, but mostly because I figured I don't have a strong handle on what is
off-topic and what isn't.  Let's all start doing that.  Of course, someone
can object to the claim, "No, I don't think this is off-topic... blah blah
blah," and people can respond.  The norms will develop.  It just requires
some relative humility, courage, and honesty.

Actually not necessarily!

To my knowledge there aren't any SPV implementations that do address
caching; they all use the peer servers in a centralized fashion every
time they connect. If those peer servers are setup to only return nodes
on one side of the fork or the other, that's all they'll connect too and
they'll never see another chain.

No, as previously explained, once libconsensus is complete it can be
moved to a separate repository like libsecp256k1.
At first it will need to be a subtree/subrepository of Bitcoin Core
(like libsecp256k1 currently is), but I still don't undesrtand how
that can possibly be a problem for alternative implementations (they
can use a subtree as well if they want to). Depending on a separated
libconsensus doesn't "make Bitcoin Core a dependency" more than
depending on libsecp256k1 currently does.

I believe the simplest option would be to fork the libconsensus
project and do the schism/controversial/contentious hardfork there.
But of course modifying libconsensus will be much easier than
modifying Bitcoin Core (if anything, because the amount of code is
much smaller).

Unfortunately I only directly contacted libbitcoin because I was
subscribed to the list at the time (maybe I'm still subscribed, not
really sure).
The other attempts to get feedback from other alternative
implementations have been just mostly-ignored threads in bitcoin-dev.
So, no, I cannot facilitate such a discussion, but I'm more than happy
to collaborate to achieve our mutual goal.

Yes, you're right, the Bitcoin Foundation is facing many challenges, but
that's an entirely different discussion.

The question in hand is this: was the request to remove Gavin made by an
individual of their own volition, reflecting their own personal opinion,
or was it made on behalf of the company?

If the latter, it would imply that compromise is unlikely to be reached
and thus the ecosystem should start planning immediately for the
potential hard fork, rather than waiting and hoping for things to be
resolved.

By the way, now that I remember why I subscribed to the libbitcoin
list I want to share it with you.
I met Amir Taaki in person in a spanish hackmeeting and had the chance
to talk a lot with him, very interesting person whose input in this
blocksize matter I would greatly appreciate. He explained some of his
concerns with Bitcoin Core (Bitcoin-qt at the time) and he
specifically named 2 persons: Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen. If I
remember correctly, Hearn had recently proposed a blacklisting scheme
for Bitcoin.

I remember I said something along the lines:
"Mike Hearn has certainly proposed some nasty things but I don't think
other devs will ever accept that kind of changes in Bitcoin-qt.
Regarding Gavin, I believe he is someone that can be trusted even if
he visited the CIA. If anything, I think he is overly conservative
about some changes, but that's very understandable given how fragile
Bitcoin is (specially at this early stage)".

Looking back, I now realize that his concerns were not exaggerated at
all and I was clearly wrong thinking Gavin was overly conservative.
He was also worried about the payment protocol and we agreed to
disagree there (maybe I should read all the payment protocol stuff
more deeply).

I don't want this to be taken as an argument of authority "Mike and
Gavin cannot be trusted because Amir didn't trust them", just as a
curious anecdote.
Amir, I wouldn't like to put words in your mouth: that's why I cc'ed
you so you can correct me in case my memory is failing.

That's a false dichotomy. We never would have considered forking Bitcoin
Core, and still wouldn't. Why would we set ourselves up for this
disruption, which would inevitably lead to us factoring the consensus
portions of libconsensus out of /bitcoin at the 11th hour?

We have to operate as if it can happen at any time. Otherwise we have
relinquished control of this vote and failed our users. Given that
operating assumption, it is much safer for us to have already done this
work (which we did). [It also provides a forcing function for us to
review in detail any consensus changes that get pushed out.]

My question is why you would not embrace an independent consensus
repository? Your work to evolve it doesn't change.

Certainly I have talked to much this month, my apologies.
I believe most of my posts (if not all) were on-topic but I could
still had repeated myself much less.
I've been trying to concentrate my usual points in documents or
threads that I can link to so that my comments can be shorter.
But, yes, most of my posts have been related to general consensus
topics and not specific to Bitcoin Core development (that's part of
why I think the bitcoin-consensus and bitcoin-dev lists would be a
good separation).
In any case, my apologies for this unplanned record.

FWIW, and I mentioned this opinion in #bitcoin-dev on IRC, but I am
perfectly fine with receiving everything through a single mailing list. I
used to read the Wikipedia firehose of recent edits because I thought
that's how you were supposed to use the site. Edits per second eventually
reached beyond any reasonable estimate of human capacity and then I
realized what was going on. Any sort of "glorious future" for bitcoin with
hundreds of millions of users will also see this problem for future
developers, even if only 0.1% of that population are money-interested
programmers then that's 100,000 programmers to work with. I would never
want to turn off this raw feed. Having said that, I am somewhat surprise
that nobody has taken to weekly summaries of research and development
activity. Summarizing recent work is a valuable task that others can engage
in just by reading the mailing list and aggregating multiple thoughts
together, similar to release notes. I was also expecting to see something
like "individual developer's summaries of things they have found
interesting over the past 30-90 days or past year" digging up arcane
details from the mailing list archives, or more infrequent summaries of the
other smaller batched review emails. Digest mode mailing list consumption
is often recommended to those who are uninterested in dealing with low
signal-to-noise, but I suspect that summarizing activity would be more
valuable for this community, especially for the different cognitive niches
that have developed.

Yes, unfortunately I don't see this happening any time soon either, at
least not with the amount of review I'm getting.
My initial hope was to complete libconsensus by 0.12 (one year should
be enough time, right?) but I was being too optimistic.
By "wait for it" I assume you mean waiting for libconsensus to be
complete before we separate it to a different repository.
The reason is just simplicity.

Yes, you need to operate as if it can happen at any time. I now
understandbetter  your position of having your own repository until a
complete libconsensus is separated.
In the meantime you will have to keep using your re-implementation of
the rest of the consensus rules (besides the script checks), but
fortunately the most risky and harder reimplementation is the part of
the script validation.

> My question is why you would not embrace an independent consensus

Yes, I want a separated repository. I just wanted to start with a
separated folder first. Right now there's consensus code all over the
place, specially in main.cpp.
I think changing the order (separated repository first, moving code
from Bitcoin Core to libconsensus later) would increase the total
amount of work.

Here's another option that has recently crossed my mind:

1) Finish the libconsensus separation in an independent branch on top
of a given version, for example 0.11.
2) Separate a repository from that. Alternative implementations can
start using a full libconsensus
3) Rebase that branch on top of bitcoin/master and start to PR small
groups of commits. Once the whole branch has been merged, Bitcoin Core
can replace the consensus folder with the libconsensus subtree, so
that Bitcoin Core itself can start using a full libconsensus.

Ironically with this plan Bitcoin Core may not be the full node first
implementation to use a full libconsensus.
There will be some consensus fork bug risks during 3 (which at the
current speed I estimate it could easily take 3 or 4 years) and there
would be some redundant work (replicating every consensus change in
both Bitcoin Core and libconsensus).
On the bright side, we may be able to have a full libconsensus this
year (which was my goal after we exposed VerifyScript in the first
libconsensus).

Thoughts?

Can this anecdote and similar be removed from the mailing list.

Possibly one of the reddits is a better place for this kind of thing.

Jorge,

separating script engine into libconsensus was very helpful, since wrapped the piece of consensus
that would least likely to be captured exactly with an implementation from scratch. Thank you for your
effort there.  Bits of Proof now uses its own or alternatively libconsensus for full validation.

I am sceptical however that a ?full? consensus lib extracted from satoshi?s code is worth trying.
Not because it was impossible, but because the result would not be higher quality, if measured on agreement
with satoshi, than other re-implementations. It would actually be lower quality because of the antique tool set.

The rules outside script engine are simpler, therefore much easier to capture exactly. They are however
scattered around in the spaghetti and are often just a single if statement, also repeated elsewhere.

You would either have to very extensively refactor the code, that unlikely goes through as a PR, or
do what me and others did. Read satoshi code and rewrite the same. You have
a slight advantage of copy-paste small fragments, but I doubt the consensus relevant advantage of that.

For the 73th time or so this month on this list:

The maximum block size consensus rule limits mining centralization
(which is currently pretty bad).

But don't worry about not being an authority on the subject: Gavin
(who has written extensively on the subject) doesn't seem to
understand this either.
He thinks it only limits full node centralization (by limiting how
expensive it can be to run a full node).
I thought the later would be quite obvious for everyone, but this
month I've discovered that I've been extremely optimistic about
people's understanding of the effects of the consensus rule they want
to change.
For the later reason (the one Gavin and I agree on) there's an old but
very clear video explaining it:

It wasn't just me: I didn't had the idea of creating a libconsensus
with a C API (thank Matt Corallo for that), I didn't removed all the
undesired dependencies or prepared the building part (thank Cory
Fields) and also thank at least Wladimir and Pieter who also
contributed in some ways I don't remember.
And of course also thank all the reviewers that made the PR merges possible.

I'm really happy to hear that libconsensus is being used, thank you
for your effort there too.

I don't understand what you mean by "quality" in this context. One of
the goals is to have as little dependencies as possible (so "more
modern tool sets" may not be suitable for libconsensus). libsecp256k1
will keep on being a dependency (highly optimized C code) and that's
about it.
Ideally I would like to slowly move libconsensus from C++ to C too,
but it seems other people would prefer to move to C++11 instead.

Yes, they are simpler and thus there's less risks of consensus fork
bugs, but it still exists.
It is true that the consensus code is currently spread all around
(specially in main.cpp), but completing libconsensus would solve that.
Lastly, since for consensus rules "the code is the specification", it
is unfortunate that the specification is coupled with a concrete
implementation (Bitcoin Core) and we should fix that.

But the goal is not reimplementing the consensus rules but rather
extract them from Bitcoin Core so that nobody needs to re-implement
them again.
It is not only exposing it but also separating it from Bitcoin Core so
that they can be changed without having to also change/take into
account non-consensus Bitcoin Core specific things.
A single PR would certainly be unacceptable, I was making many little

Every re-implementation, re-factoring even copy-paste introduces a risk of disagreement,
but also open the chance of doing the work better, in the sense of software engineering.

My goal is different. Compatibility with Bitcoin is important as I also want to deal with Bitcoins,
but it is also imperative to be able to create and serve other block chains with other rules and for those
I do not want to carry on the legacy of an antique tool set and a spaghetti style.

Bits of Proof uses scala (akka networking), java (api service), c++ (leveledb and now libconsensus)
and I am eager to integrate secp256k1 (c) as soon as part of consensus. The choices were
made because each piece appears best in what they do.

I keep seeing this notion crop up.

I want to kill this idea right now:

   - There were months of public discussion leading to up the authoring of
   BIP 101, both on this mailing list and elsewhere.

   - BIP 101 was submitted for review via the normal process. Jeff Garzik
   specifically called Gavin out on Twitter and thanked him for following the
   process:

   https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/614412097359708160

   https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/163

   As you can see, other than a few minor typo fixes and a comment by sipa,
   there was no other review offered.

   - The implementation for BIP 101 was submitted to Bitcoin Core as a pull
   request, to invoke the code review process:

   https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6341

   Some minor code layout suggestions were made by Cory and incorporated.
   Peter popped up to say there was no chance it'd ever be accepted ..... and
   no further review was done.

So the entire Bitcoin Core BIP process was followed to the letter. The net
result was this. There were, in fact, bugs in the implementation of BIP
101. They were found when Gavin submitted the code to the XT community
review process, which resulted in *actual* peer review. Additionally, there
was much discussion of technical details on the XT mailing list that
Bitcoin Core entirely ignored.

No, I said there was no chance it'd be accepted "due to a number of
BIP-level issues in addition to debate about the patch itself. For
instance, Gavin has never given any details about testing; at minimum
we'd need a BIP16 style quality assurance document. We also frown on
writing software with building expiration dates, let alone expiration
dates that trigger non-deterministically. (Note how my recently merged
CLTV considered the year 2038 problem to avoid needing a hard fork at
that date)"

Of course no further review was done - issues were identified and they
didn't get fixed. Why would we do further review on something that was
broken whose author wasn't interested in fixing even non-controversial
and obvious problems?

The process is to do review, fix issues identified, and repeat until all
issues are fixed.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Will there be a freeze of the current protocol
	version?
Message-ID: <55D5A919.3030505@olivere.de>

Hello,

BitPay seems to support BIP 101:

https://medium.com/@spair/increasing-the-block-size-limit-85ff236fc516

We do not know where this is going. But I suspect that ultimately also
the core client will increase the block size.

Bitcoin is also the subject of research. I think that research is much
to slow (and uncertain) for many companies and users. This is the
reason for XT. Nevertheless, I think further research on the base of the
current protocol version is very important. Thus, I hope that the
current block chain survives. Albeit at a lower level with fewer
users. And expressly not to sabotage necessary changes in the main project.

Let's suppose XT prevails or core is changed within the terms of BIP 101:

Do you think that there are enough people to continue with the old
protocol version? Would developers fork a Bitcoin client for supporting
the old nodes with security updates? Or will there be a compatibility
mode in XT, so that XT behave like an old Bitcoin node? What about
smaller but important projects like picocoin?

Instead of posting all these messages with bald claims why don't you 
work on a decentralization metric which you can point to?  (instead of 
trying to claim people don't understand things which is clearly not the

This is exactly the point. If shouldn't matter if somebody who forks
also tries lobbying to Bitcoin companies and miners and also trying to
convince users to adopt the fork. Bitcoin should be immune to such
attacks, otherwise it is really flawed.

Think of a very unlikely but not theoretically impossible example:
The Prime Minister of X with a government controlled authority forks
Bitcoin and changes a very important consensus rule. To ensure adoption
at hashing power level, he issues an order and raises electricity cost
for the entire population with 10 cents or so, and compensates the
miners adopting his fork with free electricity to mine Bitcoin. What
better stimulator could a miner get if not this one?

This is a social problem, not a technical one. There is no code in
Bitcoin or rule in the protocol itself to defend against such a thing.

What can and will make this attack impossible?
The users (economic power) which always ultimately should win any
dispute will refuse using the coins mined by the miners adopting the
controversial fork, which means the coins they mine will be worthless.
Even if they are created with low costs / free electricity, the mined
coins will still be worthless so it won't worth it for the miners to
take this step. Better pay for electricity and win something less vs.
not paying for electricity but winning nothing.

The same with -XT, nobody should be able to affect the entire bitcoin
ecosystem regardless how many miners or bitcoin companies you can lobby.
If this is possible, then Bitcoin is not as secure as we thought.

I agree, wrongly expressed here - sorry about it. It's true that a
software fork is nothing alike a Schism hardfork. I am still optimistic
that we aren't at a Schism hardfork yet and hope we won't get there and
-XT will rejoin in following the consensus rule and stop this division.

This is something which seams very unfair to me as well. This was my
first question after the -XT release which Mike replied to here:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010241.html

To be frank the arguments didn't convince me at all. I am against this
model where users will is ignored. By forcing you to stop using
something it's not what exactly I would call a way to express your will,
it is more like a force out.

Correct - but the point still stands. If 75% of the hashing power wants
to do something which you don't agree to, as an user you don't have any
real options to prevent them. Only game them as in don't use bitcoin to
decrease its value so they are mining worthless or less valuable coins -
but by this you are hitting Bitcoin as a whole and not just the miners.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Economic majority vote by splitting coins
Message-ID: <CAE-z3OWvA99Z9+wZ0K3XdKGZAV_XkJWYydw+Bo7tr4Oa2jQEWw@mail.gmail.com>

The economic majority is defined as the will of those who actually use
Bitcoin as a payment system.

No matter what the miners want, if users and merchants refuse to accept
their fork, then the fork loses and cannot be considered the "true" bitcoin
fork.

The problem is that it is easy to measure a miner vote.  The economic
majority is not so easy.

The relative value of two forks could be compared by adding a system
similar colored coins.

These contracts could be added with a soft fork like the P2SH one.

OP_IF
    <fork_id1> <fork_id2> OP_DROP OP_DROP OP_HASH160 <hash script 1>
OP_EQUAL
OP_ENDIF
OP_IF
     <fork_id3> OP_DROP OP_HASH160 <hash script 2> OP_EQUAL
OP_ENDIF

This works like P2SH and is template matching.  You can have as many
entries as you want.

In the example, the output can be spent on fork 1 and fork 2 by the owner
of <hash script 1> and can be spent on fork 3 by the owner of <hash script
2>.

Until the deadline, the value on each fork must be preserved when spending
the output.  If you provide the key(s), you are allowed to consolidate
entries.  You can also consolidate multiple outputs to the same key even if
you don't have the key.

This means that split outputs are a little more hassle to use and the
transactions are larger.  This doesn't matter much, since measuring the
relative value of the two sub-coins only requires some of them to be traded.

If someone wants to propose a hard fork, they create a new fork id and
deadline and release software that implements the hard fork at the given
deadline (no miner vote needed).

To prevent spam, there could be a cost to create a fork-id (BTC paid to
OP_RETURN) and the deadline could have a max time in the future (say 2
years).

After the deadline, core will allow conversion of outputs that pay to the
core fork-id (probably 1) to be converted into unencumbered outputs by the
person with the core-id script.  Likewise, the fork software will allow
outputs that pay to the fork id to be converted.  Legacy bitcoin that
haven't been "split" will be spendable on both sides equally.

This means that users can convert x legacy bitcoin into x fork-bitcoins and
x core-bitcoins in advance of the fork.

This means that Exchanges could support trading between the two.  The side
that trades with the most value is the one that is supported by the
economic majority.

As it becomes clear which side is going to win, the price of coins on the
losing side should drop.  It is unlikely that the two would stay at exactly
the same value without one side winning.

Users who want to to use the losing rules are free to do so but the
economic majority will have made its decision.

Bitcoin is only as secure as the developers, users, and miners allow it 
to be.  If you can get the majority of developers, users, and miners to 
do insecure things then Bitcoin will be insecure.

Security is provided via POW. If you want the chains to stop attacking
each other, change the POW algorithms.
Then it wouldn't matter if one chain was longer than another, each
fork would select the best chain according to their valid version of
POW algorithm.
If Bitcoin Core loses miner majority to XT this is probably what it
will have to do to maintain security of its chain.

POW is only one aspect of security and that algorithm was created by 
developers and adopted by miners.  Developers provide security by 
creating an algorithm and miners provide security by adopting it.  If 
the developers and miners decided to do something insecure then Bitcoin 
will be insecure.  POW is not some outside force.

The security of Bitcoin as a system is a very complex subject that 
involve a number of factors that are the result of actions by humans.

POW is by design the voting mechanism for the valid chain continuation.

Many rightfully dislike that the same voting mechanism is used on the validity rules, since ideally
validators (non-mining full nodes), SPV user and even those having an investment in their cold wallet
would all have a vote.

That ideal voting mechanism is not yet in the protocol.

Before XT we used discussions and an informal consensus of those with commit access to github to evolve Bitcoin.
The decision, not the discussion, is now suggested to be replaced with POW vote with XT.

It is not hard to see problems with both approaches.

If XT comes closer to miner majority, validators will also be forced to take side, so they will be able to express
their vote. I think that most Bitcoin entrepreneurs will pick XT if Core has no comparable offer
to scale transactions per second.

XT, Not-XT and a Core with some not-BIP101 offer will potentially set the stage for the perfect hard fork storm.

I still believe, that the idea of Bitcoin is powerful enough to weather that storm.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miners are struggling with blocks far smaller

That's not a valid conclusion. Just because you observe a miner producing
empty blocks doesn't mean he is SPV mining.

There can be many reasons for mining on an empty block even after having
fully verified the previous block. And therefore these reasons would be
completely independent of block size. You cannot conclude that miners are
struggling with a certain block size.

For example, there are reasons rooted in the mining hardware and mining
software itself, which have nothing to do with the node software, in
particular not with block propagation, verification or transaction
selection. See also https://github.com/BlockheaderNonce2/bitcoin/wiki where
this was warned about. The effect can be expected to become more pronounced
in the future.

> And if you see Bitcoin as a payment system where guaranteed time to confirmation is a feature, I fully agree. But I think that is an unrealistic dream. It only seems reliable because of lack of use. It costs 1.5 BTC per day to create enough transactions to fill the block chain at the minimum relay fee, and a small multiple of that at actual fee levels. Assuming that rate remains similar with an increased block size, that remains cheap.


Apologies, this is going to be long but please read it...

For starters, f the ?minimum relay fee? is 0.0001 BTC, and the proven throughput from the recent stress tests was 2.3 trx/second, it?s 0.0001 x 2.3 x 60 x 60 x 24 or 19.872 BTC to fill up the block chain for 24 hours, not 1.5 BTC.

The math error isn?t important, because the premise of what you are saying is based on a misconception.  No one is advocating that we should price fix transaction fees at some tiny amount to guarantee cheap transactions.  Furthermore, it?s perfectly realistic to believe bitcoin can scale reliably without constraining the block size to 1MB, given certain constraints.

A quick disclosure, I run a small bitcoin startup that benefits from higher bitcoin prices and more people buying bitcoin with their fiat currency. I also have an inadvisably high percentage of my remaining personal savings denominated in bitcoin.

Back to the point, limiting block size to impose fee pressure is a well intentioned idea that is built on a misconception of how bitcoin's economics work.  The price of bitcoin is based on the perceived value of units inside the protocol. Keeping transaction volumes through the bitcoin protocol capped at around 2.3 transactions / second limits the number of new people who can use bitcoin to around 100,000 people performing a little under 2 transactions daily.  This is only a tiny bit more use than where we are presently. It?s forced stagnation.

Please, read and understand: constraining the network affect and adoption of bitcoin lowers its overall value, and by extension reduces its price as denominated in other currencies.  The only alternatives presently to on blockchain transactions are centralized bank ledgers at exchanges or similar companies.  Yes, while capping the bitcoin max_block_size to a level that restricts use will drive transaction fees higher, it will also reduce the underlying price of bitcoin as denominated in other currencies, because the outside observer will see bitcoin stagnating and failing to grow like a nascent but promising technology should.  Higher fees combined with lower bitcoin price negates the value of the higher fees, and the only side effect is to stymie adoption in the process, while putting more focus on layer protocols that are no where near ready for mainstream, stable use!  

Removing the cap entirely is also a catastrophically poor idea, because some group of jerks out there will absolutely make sure that every block is 32 MB, making it a real PITA for a hobbyist to get interested in bitcoin.  Yes, some miners limit blocksize in order to balance propagation times against transaction fee revenue, so there is already a mechanism in place to push transaction fees higher by limiting size or not including transactions without fees that could offset a spam happy bad actor or group of actors, but we cannot leave that to chance.  The damage is too high to allow the risk.  Bitcoin is going to grow because each new curious, technically savvy kid who learns about it can download and participate as a full node.  We?re not anywhere close to mainstream adoption or at a level of maturity where the protocol is fully baked, so we have an obligation to keep full nodes within the grasp of a starving college kid?s budget.  That is the barometer here in my mind.  

40% should be our best guess for keeping bitcoin in reach of hobbyists, and safer from more napsteresque node centralization.  It's simple, which makes it less prone to failure and being picked apart politically as well.  It may be too fast, or it may be too slow, but it?s probably a good guess for 5 years, and if history holds true, it will work for a long time and make the cost of running a node lower gradually as well.  No one can predict the future, but this is the best we have.  No one knows if it will be radio propagation of blocks, quantum spin liquid based storage or data transmission, or some other breakthrough that drives down costs, but something always seems to appear that keeps the long term trends intact.  So why wouldn?t we use these trends?

8MB is about 40% annually from January 2009 to today.  I can buy a 5TB external hard drive right now online for $130.00 in the US.  The true block time is just over 9 minutes, so that?s 160 blocks a day x 8MB x 365.25 days a year, or around 467.52GB of new block size annually.  This is 10.69 years of storage for $130.00, or a little over $12 a year - which is darn close to what the cost was back in late 2010 when I first learned about this stuff...  I fail to see the ?centralization" issue here, and when we contrast $12/year for hobbyists against the centralization risks of mining pools, we should all be ashamed to have wasted so much energy and time talking about this specific point.  The math does not add up, and it?s not a significant centralization risk when we put an 8MB cap on this with 40% annual average growth.  The energy we?ve blown on this topic should have been put into refining privacy, and solving mining pool centralization.  There are so many more important problems.

Let's talk about other ideas for a moment.  First, while lightning is really cool and I believe it will be an exponential magnifier for bitcoin someday, that day is NOT today.  Waiting for layers over bitcoin to solve a self-imposed limit of 1mb is just a terrible, horrible idea for the health of the protocol.  Lightning is really well thought through, but there are still problems that need to be solved.  Forced channel expiration, transaction malleability are the theoretical issues that must be solved.  There WILL be issues that aren?t anticipated and known today when it goes out ?into the wild?.  Protocols of this complexity do not go from white paper to stability in less than one to two years.  Remember, even the bitcoin reference client had a catastrophic bug 1.5 years after its January 2009 launch in August 2010.  I read here that the "deepest thinkers" believe we should wait for overlays to solve this bottleneck, well, bluntly, that is far from practical or pragmatic, and is ?ivory tower? thinking.  Discussing approaches like this are worse than agreeing to do nothing, because it drains our attention away from other more pressing issues that have a time limit on our ability to solve them before the protocol crystallizes from the scale of the network effect (like privacy, mining centralization, etc.) on top of accomplishing little of immediate value other than academic debates.

I?m not winning any popularity contests today? but it was a bad idea to approach this as we did with XT.  We should have put in a solution that addressed just the cap size issue and nothing more.  Other changes, pork, and changing the nature of the community management around the XT client is just too much political baggage to work without fracturing the support of the community.  And guess what happened?  We have the major community forum moderators actively censoring posts, banning users, and things are looking to the outside observer as if the entire system is starting to fall in on itself.  Truth is ladies and gentlemen, our egos and economic interests are creating a tragedy of the commons that will hurt the lot of us far more than it will help the best off of us.  Yeah, I get that no one wants to code in a hostile environment, and this community has definitely turned caustic and behaves like a mob of petulant children, but sometimes you have to suck it up and get things done. 

So? what do we do?  We should get our @#$@ together, stop the academic grand standing and ego driven debates, raise the cap to 8mb and permit an average growth of 40% a year, then get back to solving real problems and working on layer and side chain magnifiers.  Allowing bitcoin to grow reasonably allows adoption to spread, the price to rise, which creates more demand, higher prices, and more fees.  Again, because the fees and coinbase rewards are denominated in bitcoin, this increases the return to miners.  This, combined with allowing for growth will encourage the price to rise, and increase stability for layers and side chains later on down the road when the technology is stable and mature.

For the love of whatever it is you care about, can we please just get this done?  Do I have to go brush up on my C++ and start asking everyone obnoxious, amateur questions?  Trust me, no one wants that.  Let?s just get the cap raised to 8MB + 40% on average annualized and fight viciously about privacy or mining centralization.  Something more important.  

Thanks.

If you are going to mask bits, would you consider to mask all bits 
except the 4th bit? So other fork proposals may use other bits for 
voting concurrently.

And as I understand, the masking is applied only during the voting 
stage? After the softfork is fully enforced with 95% support, the 
nVersion will be simply >=8, without any masking?

No, the nVersion would be >= 4, so that we don't waste any version values.

I dont think a libconsensus would have any kind of networking layer, nor
is C++ an antique tool set (hopefully libconsensus can avoid a boost
dependency, though thats not antique either). Ideally it would have a
simple API to give it blocks and a simple API for it to inform you of
what the current chain is. If you really want to get fancy maybe it has
pluggable block storage, too, but I dont see why you couldnt use this in
~any client?

I thought this was a good idea, so I turned my personal notes into a site
attempting to list all the strongest arguments and counterarguments on the
block size debate. I made mine a bit more detailed.

Here's the site: https://sites.google.com/site/bitcoinblocksizedebate/

Feedback welcome.

ACK on removing the inversion of nSequence from what would be human
readable.

I don't want to spend the rest of my life mentally having to subtrace
from 0xFFFFFFFF :)

I know what you mean as I already have such a component with pluggable block store and networking.
While you are at it you could aim for isolation of bitcoin specific decisions and algos from generic block chain code.

The magnitude of refactoring you would have to do to get there from main.cpp and the rest of the hairball
is harder than a re-write from scratch, and the result will not be impressive, just hopefully working.
I think a slim API server was a lower hanging fruit in Core?s case.

BTW, support for refactoring is an example where you see if your tool set is modern.

Add:

For - If everyone agrees an increase is required at some point, The longer
you leave it the greater the numbers who have to upgrade

Against - Insufficient testing before moving to production ready releases
sets a bad precedent

I'm not suggesting pluggable networking, I'm suggesting (and I think
everyone thinks the design should be) NO networking. The API is
ValidationResult libconsensus.HeyIFoundABlock(Block) and
ListOfBlocksToDownloadNext libconsensus.HeyIFoundAHeaderList(ListOfHeaders).

Are you suggesting to support altcoins? I dont think anyone cares about
supporting that.

I think you'd be very pleasantly surprised. It sounds like you havent
dug into Bitcoin Core validation code in years.

Hmm? The result would be an obviously correct consensus implementation
that everyone could use, instead of everyone going off and writing their
own and either being wrong, or never updating in the case of forks. Its
a huge deal to allow people to focus on making their libraries have good
APIs/Wallets/etc instead of focusing on making a working validation
engine (though maybe for that the p2p layer needs to also be in a library).

We have one, it just needs a few already obvious performance improvements.

There are a number of good development tools for C++ that allow this....

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Analyzing mathematical / scientific sanity of XT's
	foundation (BIP101)
Message-ID: <2872462.P4u4bhk3zl@1337h4x0r>

Hello,

For sake of peace, I wanted to give a chance to XT's block size growth efforts 
by actually *reading* BIP101 [1] which seems to be their specification.
Thus, please read this mail as something which aims to establish peaceful 
cooperation between the non-XT and XT community; not as something which wants 
to brush off BIP101 :)

Please also be aware that I am an outside non-Bitcoin developer, and thus 
judge the document merely from the stuff which it actually contains, not from 
discussions during its development.
I hope this actually allows increased objectivity: A scientific document 
such as BIP101 should be fully self-contained.

BIP101 proposes this:
> The maximum size shall be 8,000,000 bytes at a timestamp of 2016-01-11
> 00:00:00 UTC (timestamp 1452470400), and shall double every 63,072,000
> seconds (two years, ignoring leap years), until 2036-01-06 00:00:00 UTC
> (timestamp 2083190400). The maximum size of blocks in between doublings
> will increase linearly based on the block's timestamp. The maximum size of
> blocks after 2036-01-06 00:00:00 UTC shall be 8,192,000,000 bytes.

I.e. a fixed function instead of adaptive, demand-based growth.
Let us for a moment give the benefit of doubt and blindly assume that a fixed 
function is better than the adaptive growth which I advocated [2].

If we ignore the reasons [3] behind the choice of the initial value of 8MB 
for simplicity, what this function aims to model is this:
> The doubling interval was chosen based on long-term growth trends for CPU
> power, storage, and Internet bandwidth. The 20-year limit was chosen
> because exponential growth cannot continue forever. If long-term trends do
> not continue, maximum block sizes can be reduced by miner consensus (a
> soft-fork).

So you're trying to match a natural process of resource growth with a bounded 
exponential growth function. I would blind-guess the natural growth to be 
something like [4] or [5]. Your function is not symmetrical, so it is for sure 
not aims to be [4], rather maybe close to [5] ?

Let us blindly assume it is a honorable and adequate way of limiting resource 
usage to try to limit usage of a resource (= block size) to a function which 
matches measured natural supply of the resource (= available CPU / storage / 
network as the proposed function aims to model).
We can probably all say that this is a standard scientific behavior, and used 
in many systems.

Now what is also the mathematical / scientific standard is this:
If you aim to match a natural dataset with a model function of it, you 
provide:

1) a plot of the measurements of the natural data you're trying to match. 
I.e. you plot your source data behind "based on long-term growth trends for 
CPU power, storage, and Internet bandwidth". I am unable to locate such a plot 
in the BIP101 document; and also not a link to the raw source data. Can you 
please provide at least the raw data, if not a plot?

2) a plot of your model function. Also cannot find this in BIP101. Can you 
please provide it?

3) a joined plot of 1 and 2. This is what will prove whether your model is 
adequate: If the source data and your model function match, it is. This is the 
central thing I am missing in BIP101.

I would be happy if you could provide the plots, or at least the raw data. I 
would love to offer help with GnuPlot, but this will take some weeks [6].

Let me stress further possible mathematical problems which show why the plots 
are important for deciding whether BIP101 is a good idea:

Once we have a plot of the functions, the central question will be this:
Has the natural source data sufficiently revealed its saturation curve so we 
can guess its defining constants?
This is important because: While the logistic function [4] seems to be 
symmetrical, and thus the constants are revealed without nature reaching 
saturation yet, it is quite possible that the natural growth of CPU / disk / 
network is rather a generalised logistic function [5] which is not 
symmetrical. Then we would have to wait until saturation starts so we can 
guess the constants needed to model it.

Thus, if natural growth has not reached the beginning of saturation yet, and 
the saturation curve cannot be guessed, it is questionable of whether BIP101 
is adequate: It is then possible that natural saturation is slower than 
BIP101-saturation (= more resources will be available than consumed), and in 
the future we will reach a situation where blocks are smaller than the natural 
capacity again.
Then the whole discussion to increase block size will happen again - but 
possibly with a much larger economy behind Bitcoin, and thus much less 
possibility of reaching consensus.

Thus, in conclusion, please:
- provide plots, or at least data.
- once you have the plots, be open to scientifically admit that BIP101 might 
be insufficient if the plots show the open questions I have just elaborated. I 
am also open to admitting that your data is sufficient from what I can say 
:)

DISCLAIMER: I am in no way good at math. Hence please only use my elaborations 
to disprove stuff, not to prove it.

Pieter built a nice simulation tool and posted some results.

I tweaked the parameters and ran the tool in a way that tested ONLY for 
hashrate centralization effects, and did not conflate these with network 
partitioning effects.

I found that small miners were not at all disadvantaged by large blocks.

The only person who commented on this result agreed with me.  He also 
complimented Pieter's insight (which is entirely appropriate since 
Pieter did the hard work of creating the tool).

You used 20% as the size of the large miner, with all the small miners
having good connectivity with each other.

That is *not* the scenario we're worried about. The math behind the
issue is that the a miner needs to get their blocks to at least 33% of
hashing power, but more than that is unnecessary and only helps their
competition; you simulated 20%, which is under that threshold. Equally,
why are you assuming the small miner group is well connected to each
other?

You probably didn't get any replies because your experiment is obviously
wrong and misguided, and we're all busy.

The idea is to come up with some sort of standardized metric so as the 
tools and issues come up you are comparing similar things.

The first thing you have to do is link "centralization pressure" and 
(pressure to merge with a big miner) to some sort of overall 
decentralization metric.  For instance, how much do big miners reduce 
decentralization to begin with?  That is a complicated analysis on its 
own.  Then you can measure specif use cases with a tool like that.

the idea at least is that the metrics do not "take sides" on any issue 
and just provide a measure of whatever it is you are measuring.

most of the references have to do with measuring decentralization in 
political systems so a system would need to be developed to apply to 
software projects like Bitcoin:

Yes, I am familiar with the process as i spent years doing it.  Many 
here are familiar with the Bitcoin issues but they are not familiar with 
addressing risk in a systematic way.  There are many good posts but they 
are dispersed among thousands of messages and the discussions are in a 
variety of contexts.  As a result, the same things are often argued over 
and over and much time is wasted.  Note that knowing a technical area 
and knowing a process to analyze metrics are two different things.

I am glad you want to participate in such a process.  Several developers 
on this list have mentioned the need for a decentralization metric so i 
think that is a good place to start.  I suggest getting the other 
developers/experts together and send me the various into and tools you 
have and I will put it together into a useable format.  The idea is to 
create a living document so people can discuss changes in a similar 
context.

Bitcoin XT isn't technically an implementation of BIP 101.

It's really just an attack on the bitcoin network, not a whole
different than any of a variety of attacks one could perform on the
network.

Facts are as follows.

The published implementation of BIP 101 is shown on the BIP 101 page:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki

at:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0101.mediawiki#Implement
ation

The only text in the Implementation section is the following link:

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6341

Which is closed by Gavin.

I am wondering why this drama continues, sort of stunned (but not
surprised) by Hearn's XT-hyping, bitcoin-attacking behavior and
crazed, delusional attitude, and hoping that consensus will be reached
on something - by something, I mean one of the following as shown at
http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/ -
well before XT achieves its goals.

By the way, since http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/ doesn't yet
appear to have any developers' signatures on it (except for luke-jr),
I'd like to take a moment to ask the developers if you could please
visit that site and put your signatures to it.  (Thanks to luke-jr for
being the first one.)

To answer your question, from my perspective, I am not opposed to
block size increase.. I am hoping it would be in the context of
something like BIP 100 as I've said before.

But I'm extremely opposed to XT.

Would I continue with bitcoin if things continue and "XT prevails" as
you put it?  That is addressed in part here in this thread:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1157545.msg12196537

Basically, in short, I would fight it as long as possible.
I won't use XT, and I suspect there are many like myself who will
never use it as well.

I was looking at this site recently and it's not very clear that by
clicking the name you get their opinion. I would make that a separate
column stated, Technical Opinion.

I think you need to include more of the developers/technical people,
Adam Back, Mark Friedenback, Jorge Timons, (all of who are core
developers). You need
Peter Todd is a core dev btw, as is thebluematt.

You need other experts, I would include Nick Szabo, Meni Rosenfeld,
Charlie Lee might be a good one. You should get the pools on there
too.

You're missing Mike Hearn of course.

Hi All,

I put together a draft describing an idea I had for an alternate set of 
chain mechanics which solve some of the problems I see with existing 
proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems (mining centralization, wealth 
concentration, nothing-at-stake, lack of full-node incentives, etc.). 
I'd love to get feedback on the idea.

Thanks,
Asher

That's interesting.  But in all honesty I don't see most users being
able to pull off what you are describing.  If people don't want XT it
isn't going to get used. If they are convinced that it is needed its
use will grow but they won't realize how bad they will be misled until
later, at which point it will be...

.. Too Late

This is a simple post.

Who's got visualizations of votes?

One I've seen that I liked was

http://bipsxdevs.azurewebsites.net/

This just covered how developers feel about the various BIPs though.

A visualization I would like to see would include:

pie graph(s) of what % are voting for (BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, BIP sipa
etc) based on what's published in blocks.

Has anyone hacked up such a thing which would describe miner voting,
etc. visually in real time?

Thanks, btcdrak, I just added the column and you in the list. (looks nicer)

What I am calling "core devs" in the website is only "commit access
people", should I rename this group ?
I just want a way to improve readability of the website by grouping, I am
open to all subjection on different way of grouping.

I'm good for adding Mike Hearn, Adam Back, Mark Friedenback, Jorge Timons,
Nick Szabo, Meni Rosenfeld, Charlee Lee.

If some of you are reading this list, please send me your PGP public key.
For the others, any idea where I can hunt their PGP public keys ?

If such a vote existed, I would gladly show the pie on BIPxDevs.
However there is no standard way for miners to vote informally BIP they
support.

I'm not against it (mostly active committers as you are), my challenge is
getting the PGP keys scattered all over the place.
If you want put your thoughts, then let me know you pgp.

I think this is a bit well, sad, at the moment--  a basic principle in
sound decision making is that one should try to withhold judgement
until after the analysis and options are laid out to avoid prematurely
laying down "battle lines" which then they're socially and politically
committed to a particular answer.


There are several other BIPs in the works right now that aren't out
there yet, as well (as presumably) new insight from the workshop. It
would be a shame if these things would be for naught because of being
decided prematurely.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Revisiting NODE_BLOOM: Proposed BIP
Message-ID: <55D6AD19.10305@mattcorallo.com>

Peter: Since I stole most of this text from your old BIP, should I leave
you as an author?

BIP: ?
Title: NODE_BLOOM service bit
Author: Matt Corallo <bip at bluematt.me>, Peter Todd <pete at petertodd.org>
Type: Standards Track (draft)
Created: 20-08-2015

Abstract
========

This BIP extends BIP 37, Connection Bloom filtering, by defining a
service bit to allow peers to advertise that they support bloom filters
explicitly. It also bumps the protocol version to allow peers to
identify old nodes which allow bloom filtering of the connection despite
lacking the new service bit.


Motivation
==========

BIP 37 did not specify a service bit for the bloom filter service, thus
implicitly assuming that all nodes that serve peers data support it.
However, the connection filtering algorithm proposed in BIP 37, and
implemented in several clients today, has been shown to provide little
to no privacy, as well as being a large DoS risk on some nodes. Thus,
allowing node operators to disable connection bloom filtering is a
much-needed feature.


Specification
=============

The following protocol bit is added:

    NODE_BLOOM = (1 << 2)

Nodes which support bloom filters should set that protocol bit.
Otherwise it should remain unset. In addition the protocol version is
increased from 70002 to 70011 in the reference implementation. It is
often the case that nodes which have a protocol version smaller than
70011, but larger than 70000 support bloom filtered connections without
the NODE_BLOOM bit set, however clients which require bloom filtered
connections should avoid making this assumption.

NODE_BLOOM is distinct from NODE_NETWORK, and it is legal to advertise
NODE_BLOOM but not NODE_NETWORK (eg for nodes running in pruned mode
which, nonetheless, provide filtered access to the data which they do have).

If a node does not support bloom filters but receives a "filterload",
"filteradd", or "filterclear" message from a peer the node should
disconnect that peer immediately. For backwards compatibility, in
initial implementations, nodes may choose to only disconnect nodes which
have the new protocol version set and attempt to send a filter command.

While outside the scope of this BIP it is suggested that DNS seeds and
other peer discovery mechanisms support the ability to specify the
services required; current implementations simply check only that
NODE_NETWORK is set.


Design rational
===============

A service bit was chosen as applying a bloom filter is a service.

The increase in protocol version is for backwards compatibility. In
initial implementations, old nodes which are not yet aware of NODE_BLOOM
and use a protocol version < 70011 may still send filter* messages to a
node without NODE_BLOOM. This feature may be removed after there are
sufficient NODE_BLOOM nodes available and SPV clients have upgraded,
allowing node operators to fully close the bloom-related DoS vectors.


Reference Implementation

Decision making is not the goal of this site, it is only a way to see
various pros and cons of various devs on various proposals in a single
place.
This is for the community to have a coherent view about what you are
talking about now spread into reddit/mailing/forums.

If you did not analyzed a proposal yet, you don't have to fill out your
opinion veto or approval.
It is only to show what you would you "approve" and what you would "veto",
after your analysis.
Then point out all the discussions in the opinion section that lead you to
your conclusion.

You can change edit your position as you progress into your analysis and as
new BIP get redacted.
I'm eager to include the new proposals.

What about formal votes? Is there a way to visually have them appear
in a pie chart as the votes become apparent in blocks?

I appreciate good visualizations and am trying to get a (visual)
comparison of the votes on these competing proposals.

I'd reference that paper on bloom filters re: the "little to no privacy"
issue. There's also a post in the bitcoinj mailing list somewhere IIRC
talking about the default settings, and how they don't provide any
privacy.

Good to note Mike Hearn's Cartography seed protocol here.

Ah good! That solves the backwards compatibility quite nicely.

Oh, and we should also point out that Bloom filters have scaling issues,
as each application of the filter has to scan the whole blockchain -
with future blocksize increases these issues increase, in some proposals
quite dramatically. The underlying idea also conflicts with some
proposals to "shard" the blockchain, again suggesting that we need a bit
to handle future upgrades to more scalable designs.

If this is widely deployed + enabled, what is the impact to current wallets

See my comment on the recently-opened issue, reproduced below. In short,
not all that much, especially if we adopt my suggestion of having the
Core implementation accept and respond to bloom filter requests from
non-upgraded clients regardless of whether or not NODE_BLOOM was set
until some fixed upgrade deadline in the future.


    Note that since the last time NODE_BLOOM was proposed, the landcape for
    (lite-)SPV clients has changed significantly in a few key ways:

    1) @mikehearn's [Cartographer](https://github.com/mikehearn/httpseed)
    seed protocol has been created and deployed in production to allow
    (lite-)SPV clients to find nodes supporting arbitrary service bits,
    notable NODE_GETUTXOs.

    2) Bloom filter usage has declined significantly, as lite-SPV clients
    are moving towards using centralized, trusted, servers run by the wallet
    authors. For instance
    [Mycelium](https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet),
    [GreenBits](https://github.com/greenaddress/GreenBits),
    [AirBitz](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3etohn/whats_wrong_with_breadwallet/ctirou5),
    and [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home) all fall in this category.

    3) Bloom filters [have been found](http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/763) to
    have severe privacy issues, offering essentially no privacy at all.
    Under many threat models a small number of trusted servers pose less
    privacy security risk than connecting to random, sybil-attackable, peers
    using unencrypted connections and giving those peers very accurate
    wallet contents information.

    4) Finally, Bloom filters still have [unsolved DoS attack
    issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hjak7/the_hard_work_of_core_devs_not_xt_makes_bitcoin/cu9xntf?context=3),
    that will get significantly worse under upcoming blocksize increase
    proposals.

I don't see any link to data backing up "Bloom filter usage has declined
significantly"

Is there actual data showing this feature's use is declining or
non-existent?

I run a number of high speed nodes and while I don't have historical
logs handy over time, I've noticed a drop from about %5-%10 SPV clients
at any one time to closer to %1 (Matt: you have a few TB of logs saved
don't you?)

Also, as I mentioned, just look at the popularity of wallets such as
Mycelium that are not adopting bloom filters, but going with SPV
verification of block headers w/ lookup servers.

Anyway, look at the analogous implementation of NODE_GETUTXO's, which
helpfully has provided the infrastructure for wallets that need bloom
filters to find appropriate nodes to connect too - we certainely aren't
seeing any shortages of nodes for those wallets to use.

Thinking in Bitcoins only on the level of technology unnecessarily narrows your view.

OK, I hope to be pleasantly surprised.

None of these wallets (except Electrum maybe) could gain a significant
amount of new users during the last year or so, if you look at the stats
of Google Play.

Specifically Mycelium lost a significant amount of users during the last
stress test when their centralized infrastructure was overloaded. As a
consenquence, their developer announced on Reddit to try moving the
wallet to SPV.

The most important part that developers should complete is the
"Technical Opinion" column section where they can explain their
general worldview, what their concerns are, how those concerns would
be alleviated. If one is undecided or does not have enough information
regarding each BIP then dont fill it out. That also helps signal the
level of consensus for a proposal.

As it stands at the moment, it's almost impossible to direct someone
at the opinion of a specific developer other than hunting down a few
gems scattered to the four corners of the universe. I tried recently
and it was simply impossible. At least with this system, specific BIPs
aside, we can easily see the view of each developer. I think most of
us can comment on BIP101 since the BIP appears non-negotiable.

The XT faction are easily winning the media war by obscuring rational
debate by high signal to noise ratio. Nicolas' solution means the most
important views expressed by each heavyweight will not get lost and
serve as a good reference point for everyone, including the media.

The site could be extended to include major stakeholders too like
major service providers (think exchanges, wallet providers etc) and
mining pools.

I'll second that, which is why I've mostly not commented on whether or not particular proposals are good ideas, except in the case where they're obviously broken due to reasons other than the blocksize itself. For instance both of Garzik's proposals and Andresen's BIP101 have serious flaws regardless of your thoughts on the blocksize, which is why I've commented on them. Wuille's OTOH is implemented well, which is why I have not commented about it.

What might be valuable is to ask devs to explain what their threat models are, what should be at the root of their thinking about the blocksize.

That's exactly what the "Technical Opinion" column is for.

Given the strong consensus that blockchains simply don't scale well - even Andersen describes a blocksize increase as "kicking then can down the road" - it'd be good to ask service providers what their long term plans for growth are.

I like the intend of this attempt to bring more clarity to the blocksize
debate, however it would be more help to make this a information site about
the current outstanding BIPs and summarize their differences rather than
voting mechanism.
 (ofcourse the author of the BIPs would "vote" for their own proposals.)

It would be good to include supporting and counter statements regards to
these BIPs on the site.
in addition to highlight certain things like pools in china have voiced
their opinion that increase should happen, and 8mb is something they are
comfortable with, which is not directly related to a single BIP, but never
the less relevant in this discussion.

The idea assumes that it is a BIP + soft fork.  This means that most
wallets would support/recognise the encumbered coins.

Even if only some wallets support it, you can still move your coins
around.  Only the people who are trading between XT and Core would need to
have wallets that support it.

If you consolidate x BTC-Core and x BTC-XT into a single output, then you
can convert it back to a normal output.

That is the point, this gives a sneak preview.  At minimum, it shows which
choice will give the highest BTC value.

I was rather surprised by the tweet from AntPool[1] today saying that
they support big blocks and would be prepared to upgrade to XT. Pools
have stated that they are willing to increase to a maximum of 8MB, but
upgrading to XT puts them on a schedule towards 8GB which is clearly
not what they have agreed to.

Do you have any insights into what's going on there?

Also do you have any insight into what Chinese pools would accept as a
compromise in terms of raising the blocksize limit?

If your goal is to get the Miners (who are highly centralised today) to
implement a change in consensus rule that will limit mining centralisation,
guess what public position you will be taking?

accordingly to public release[1], They.

1. agreed that blocksize increase is needed.
2. opposed original 20mb, suggest 8mb instead as it is more technically
reasonable.
3. do not want blocksize to change in the "short term future" ( direct
translation. ) and in the document states.
"after discussion we are in agreement that the blocksize should be within
the ball park of 8mb for the short term future."

They have no explicitly rejected or supported the other components of
BIP101. It's my opinion that as long as the change is < 8mb. they'll take
it.

I don't believe in trying to predict the future, on adoption, technology
growth, nor geopolitics. I think it matters very little which BIP we need
up deploying, as long as all the attack vectors are covered, especially for
the dynamically adjustable ones.

One thing is for sure though, not increasing the blocksize is not an option.

we can't predict the future, in the mean time, Hardfork Responsibly?.

Why not? The blocksize increase eliminates the pressure to seek durable
solutions. But it will turn out differently. Other than we all think.

I really can not imagine that a 20-year plan will be successful. At one
point we like to clear away the auto-increase. I think that is the only
thing for sure at the moment.

I hope that the current protocol and blockchain will be continued.
Perhaps with fewer people. That would settles the matter for the time
being. ;)

Keeping the block size at 1mb restricts the number of active users of bitcoin to around 100,000 people transacting twice a day on blockchain.  

BItcoin is a protocol.  Protocols are successful because of their network effect.  Capping the block size freezes bitcoin?s network effect, limits users and prevents new users from joining (which will cut demand to exchange bitcoin) and also freeze the economic incentive to mine, because it will hurt the price.  

Keeping the 1MB cap in place is horrible for the health of bitcoin.  It?s good for competing protocols that want a chance to ?catch up?. 

Freezing bitcoin?s growth for any meaningful length of time will threaten its position as the leading cryptocurrency.  Reasonable, controlled growth is a good thing.  BIP101 should be rolled into core as soon as feasible.

I gave the small miners collectively the same hashrate as the large
miners in the original test.  I made them well-connected because
everyone was well-connected intra-partition in the original test.

I just varied one thing: the size of the miners.  This is a principle of
experiment design, in science.

Next you'll probably claim that second-order and cross-term effects
dominate.  Maybe you can find the time to prove it.

My UX skills are lacking a bit. You can edit all your thoughts about each
BIP, HTML is accepted, so you can link to other posts you made somewhere
else.
When you click on a cell in the grid, it forward you to the page that the
dev edited for this BIP.

This website is not only to say "approve", "disapprove", nor is it about a
formal process for reaching agreement.
This is a tool, a portal, which educates people, and permit you to link all
of your thoughts about the various BIP and show it to others.

With the opinions browse able from the same website, you will notice in a
gleam as soon as one of those proposal reach consensus. (I think SIPA's BIP
has a chance to do so, but nobody knows it yet)
Sadly, the most controversial is a BIP, the noisier it is, at the expense
of those which are not. (like sipa's one).

It irritates me a lot that the debate in public mind is "XT or not" /
"Bigger blocks or not", when in reality there is lots of different
proposals that might also reach consensus but are lost in the noise.
I will add any BIP that at least one voter approve and want to push forward.
I plan to add merchants/wallet providers/mining pools later.

As a protocol Bitcoin could support millions of full nodes. What you
talking about is the number of shareholders. But these are poorly
determined by the block size. The number of shareholders is determined
by many parameter but manly by the decreasing-supply algorithm. Which
"was chosen because it approximates the rate at which commodities like
gold are mined". See: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply

While the decreasing-supply algorithm of Bitcoin has many advantage it's
very hard to believe that the block chain will ever reach mass adoption.
Even after 6 years, hardly anyone owns Bitcoins. Like Gold Bitcoin is
distributed in large blocks to a few. Exceptions prove the rule. In the
last 6 years the 1MB limit has been sufficient. I don't think that we
will hit the 8MB limit in the next 6 years, except for stress tests and
spam.

> Freezing bitcoin?s growth for any meaningful length of time will

I don't think that a relative tight block size could harm Bitcoin
middle-term. Only experienced users penetrate the block chain directly.
They know what they are doing and deal with problems. When space for
transactions starts to become scarce and the fees rise too much, the
developers have enough time to make a change. It would then also not so
controversial. A matter of a few days or weeks. Especially if all
necessary preparations have already been taken.

But I know that my opinion is very different from other claims. However,
reliable people share some more fatalism as I'm currently find in some
parts of the the Bitcoin community. Fear is a very bad adviser and can
make a genius stupid.

The proposal will not break any existing clients in the first release.
After sufficient time to upgrade SPV clients, a new version will be
released which will result in older SPV clients finding themselves
disconnected from peers when they send filter* commands, so they can go
find other peers which do support bloom filtering.

Revised copy follows. re: mentioning the HTTP seeding stuff, I'm not
sure we want to encourage more people aside from bitcoinj to use
that...I thought about adding a DNS seed section to this bip, but
decided against it...still, I think we should add the option to select
service bits to DNS seeds ASAP.

Re: need to "shard" the blockchain: not sure what you're referring to
here. The bloom filter stuff requires you to download the chain
in-order, sure, but you have to do that for headers anyway, and
hopefully your total data isnt too much more than headers alone.

Anyone have the best reference for the DoS issues?

BIP: ?
Title: NODE_BLOOM service bit
Author: Matt Corallo <bip at bluematt.me>, Peter Todd <pete at petertodd.org>
Type: Standards Track (draft)
Created: 20-08-2015

Abstract
========

This BIP extends BIP 37, Connection Bloom filtering, by defining a
service bit to allow peers to advertise that they support bloom filters
explicitly. It also bumps the protocol version to allow peers to
identify old nodes which allow bloom filtering of the connection despite
lacking the new service bit.


Motivation
==========

BIP 37 did not specify a service bit for the bloom filter service, thus
implicitly assuming that all nodes that serve peers data support it.
However, the connection filtering algorithm proposed in BIP 37, and
implemented in several clients today, has been shown to provide little
to no privacy[1], as well as being a large DoS risk on some nodes[2].
Thus, allowing node operators to disable connection bloom filtering is a
much-needed feature.


Specification
=============

The following protocol bit is added:

    NODE_BLOOM = (1 << 2)

Nodes which support bloom filters should set that protocol bit.
Otherwise it should remain unset. In addition the protocol version is
increased from 70002 to 70011 in the reference implementation. It is
often the case that nodes which have a protocol version smaller than
70011, but larger than 70000 support bloom filtered connections without
the NODE_BLOOM bit set, however clients which require bloom filtered
connections should avoid making this assumption.

NODE_BLOOM is distinct from NODE_NETWORK, and it is legal to advertise
NODE_BLOOM but not NODE_NETWORK (eg for nodes running in pruned mode
which, nonetheless, provide filtered access to the data which they do have).

If a node does not support bloom filters but receives a "filterload",
"filteradd", or "filterclear" message from a peer the node should
disconnect that peer immediately. For backwards compatibility, in
initial implementations, nodes may choose to only disconnect nodes which
have the new protocol version set and attempt to send a filter command.

While outside the scope of this BIP it is suggested that DNS seeds and
other peer discovery mechanisms support the ability to specify the
services required; current implementations simply check only that
NODE_NETWORK is set.


Design rational
===============

A service bit was chosen as applying a bloom filter is a service.

The increase in protocol version is for backwards compatibility. In
initial implementations, old nodes which are not yet aware of NODE_BLOOM
and use a protocol version < 70011 may still send filter* messages to a
node without NODE_BLOOM. This feature may be removed after there are
sufficient NODE_BLOOM nodes available and SPV clients have upgraded,
allowing node operators to fully close the bloom-related DoS vectors.

  I am not talking about "shareholders? who own bitcoin, or the supply of bitcoin at all.  I?m talking about active users of bitcoin.  I don?t care if they send 10,000 BTC, or .01 BTC, usage is adoption.  Putting a 1MB cap on block size caps transaction volume, which by definition blocks adoption and use.

You can think what you like, but I find your position on this specious.  You don?t know if we will hit that limit in the next 6 years.  All it takes is one moderately successful application and we could be hitting that limit with very little warning.  It could be open bazaar, or something else.  Stating that ?even after 6 years, hardly anyone owns Bitcoins.? as a justification that it will stay small doesn?t hold water either in terms of common sense or when looking at other standards evolving through history.  TCP/IP was declared as a standard by the US Military in 1982 and became a public standard in 1985.  Normal people didn?t start using TCP/IP until much later, when Mark Andreessen created the Mosaic internet browser, the precursor to Netscape.  It was released in 1993.  Widespread use didn?t really kick in until the second half of that decade.  The reference bitcoin client was released in January 2009.  So it?s basically 1988 for bitcoin, if we use the internet as a proxy - one way to look at it.  The telephone even took 50 years to become widespread.

This is insane.  You actually believe this?  Capping the block size at 1MB doesn?t just cause fees to rise.  It caps transactions that can be performed.  This caps the number of users who can access bitcoin, directly cuts demand, which kills the price, which kills the mining, and BAM Rome falls.  Only experienced users can ?penetrate? the block chain directly?  Seriously?  You download a software application, or sign up for a web wallet, buy some bitcoin on an exchange or have a friend send you some, and send it.  Try bread wallet.  My mom can do it.  She is in her 70?s and couldn?t program a VCR 20 years ago.

I am just going to stop here.  I really hope you change the way you are looking at bitcoin.  This is not what it was meant to be, and if it ever becomes this, I?m not going to be interested in it.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Censorship
Message-ID: <20150821130333.Horde.9zPFmy3VMqAO5FGReDHaRg1@www.vfemail.net>

People are wondering why there is such a division in the bitcoin community
at this time. Bitcoin as a whole is only so big. The bitcoin discussion
communities are spread out, but there are only a few popular ones.
BitcoinTalk and Reddit seem to be the largest, most popular where bitcoin
discussion happens consistently and from almost everyone in the community
(devs, users, btc companies, merchants, and so on). I think we all know
where this is going. If not, here you go. BitcoinTalk and Reddit are
managed by a single person: Theymos. It's become quite clear over the past
several days/weeks, that Theymos is highly censoring bitcoin discussion,
mainly on Reddit, but also BitcoinTalk. If this single person is able to
censor content, and hush the debate, he (and whatever his agenda is), wins.
How can we as a community discuss these proposed changes, if the discussion
is from a one sided point of view? There doesn't seem to be a solution at
this time, but I find it dissapointing that many (in this very email list)
aren't discussing this important part of the issue. Maybe it's becuase
Theymos is anti-bigger blocks, which seems to coincide with the Blockstream
point of view, which many of the core devs belong to.

I dont see any problem with such limits. Though, hell, if you limited
entire tx dependency trees (ie transactions and all required unconfirmed
transactions for them) to something like 10 txn, maximum two levels
deep, I also wouldnt have a problem.

But you don't want something better, you want something functionally identical.
You may want to watch sipa's explanation on why "the implementation is
the specification" and the reasons to separate libconsensus:

Since you already depend on libconsensus for VerifyScript, wouldn't it
be nice that it also offered VerifyTx, VerifyHeader and VerifyBlock?
You would still have complete control over storage, concurrency,
networking, policy...
My plan is for the C API to interface with the external storage by
passing a function pointer to it.

The limits Alex proposed are generous (bordering on obscene!), but dropping
that down to allowing only two levels of chained unconfirmed transactions
is too tight.

Use case: Brokered asset transfers may require sets of transactions with a
dependency tree depth of 3 to be published together. ( N seller txs, 1
broker bridge tx, M buyer txs )

If the originally proposed depth limit of 100 does not provide a sufficient
cap on memory consumption or loop/recursion depth, a depth limit of 10
would provide plenty of headroom for this 3 level use case and similar
patterns.

Unfortunately we have no way of rigorously proving functional equivalence
other than code review and unit testing. The simpler the consensus code
(and the more we can write it in a style that affords provability of
correctness) the easier it will be in the future to compare implementations.

Prior to swapping out implementations, we should at the least run it
through the gauntlet and perhaps run both implementations side-by-side.

All I/O should be treated abstractly in the API.

In C++ I really like using a nearly bare-bones signal template for most
async message handling, i.e.
https://github.com/ciphrex/mSIGNA/blob/master/deps/Signals/src/Signals.h

This greatly facilitates support for async bidirectional I/O, etc...with
minimal overhead.

But others might have other stylistic preferences.

The rule is already there. My goal is to make sure we understand the
potential consequences of changing that rule in the "less limitation
to mining centralization" better before changing it.

Please start with the centralization metrics we both agree are

I'm not inventing this, he recently said so himself publicly on this
mailing list:

"I don't believe that the maximum block size has much at all to do with
mining centralization"

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/009960.html

It is therefore not surprising that non-developers and developers with
less experience in Bitcoin than Gavin have similar misunderstandings.

That claim seems in contradiction with his earlier analysis:
http://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners

"I ran some simulations, and if blocks take 20 seconds to propagate, a
network with a miner that has 30% of the hashing power will get 30.3%
of the blocks."

That's why I was surprised when he denied the relation between the
consensus maximum size and mining centralization, but hey, people
change their minds and that's completely fine. I change my mind about
many things quite often myself. For example, I will change my mind
about not touching the maximum blocksize consensus rule as soon as I
see some data that convinces that the proposed sizes are not very
risky.

Jameson,

I like your thinking about the implicit reward of full nodes. It was not perceived as sufficient by many, hence full node counts were falling.

This might reverse now as the implicit value of validating yourself however becomes higher in a heterogenous environment, that is if there are hard forks in the wild.

Actually pooled mining became an option through the homogenous nature of the network.

Hector,
 I can only say 2 things in the brief time I have now:

1. There is a solution that I proposed for proving you own a copy of the
block-chain. It's using aymmetric-time functions:

https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2014/11/03/proof-of-local-blockchain-storage/

2. I'm finishing a paper on a transaction system (DAGCoin) which relies on
proof-of-work per transactions, and no per blocks. Actually it has no
blocks.

This has been explored in the past, but I came up with some basic ideas
that make this work a few months ago. I will forward a draft to you while
at the same time I try to analyze your proposal. Or I may publish the draft
altogether.

Best regards,
 Sergio

"I ran some simulations, and if blocks take 20 seconds to propagate, a
network with a miner that has 30% of the hashing power will get 30.3% of
the blocks."

Peter_R's analysis of fee markets in the absence of blocksize limits [1]
shows that the hashrate advantage of a large miner is a side-effect of
coinbase subsidization. As the block rewards get smaller, so will large
miner advantages. An easy way to think about this is as follows:

Currently, the main critique of larger blocksizes is that we'll connected
miners can cut out smaller miners by gratuitously filling up blocks with
self-paying transactions. This only works because block subsidies exist.
The moment block rewards become comparable to block TX fees, this exploit
ceases to be functional.

Basically, large miners will still be forced to move full blocks, but it
will go against their interest to fill them with spam since their main
source of income is the fees themselves. As a result, large miners (unlike
smaller ones) will lose the incentive to mine an un full block this evening
the playing field.

In this context, large blocksizes as proposed by BIP100-101 hope to
stimulate the increase of TX fees by augmenting the network's capacity. The
sooner block rewards become comparable to block fees, the sooner we will
get rid of mine centralization.

I have tried to solve the maximum block size debate in two different
proposal.

i. Depending only on previous block size calculation.

ii. Depending on previous block size calculation and previous Tx fee
collected by miners.


Proposal 1: Depending only on previous block size calculation

If more than 50% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the last
difficulty period, is more than 90% MaxBlockSize
    Double MaxBlockSize
Else if more than 90% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the last
difficulty period, is less than 50% MaxBlockSize
    Half MaxBlockSize
Else
    Keep the same MaxBlockSize
Proposal 2: Depending on previous block size calculation and previous Tx
fee collected by miners

TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty = Sum of all Tx fees of first 2008 blocks
in last 2 difficulty period
TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty = Sum of all Tx fees of second 2008 blocks in
last 2 difficulty period (This actually includes 8 blocks from last but one
difficulty)

If ( ( (Sum of first 4016 block size in last 2 difficulty period)/4016 >
50% MaxBlockSize) AND (TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty >
TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty) )
    MaxBlockSize = TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty * MaxBlockSize /
TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty
Else If ( ( (Sum of first 4016 block size in last 2 difficulty period)/4016
< 50% MaxBlockSize) AND (TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty <
TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty) )
    MaxBlockSize = TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty * MaxBlockSize /
TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty
Else
    Keep the same MaxBlockSize
Details: http://upalc.com/maxblocksize.php

Requesting for comment.

Well, in general relying on seeds every time you start your node is a
really bad idea; doing so much be carefully weighed against the
downsides and should be used only as a last resort. Nodes should be
doing caching and proper gossip protocol participation whenever
possible. (note how bitcoinj nodes *do* rely on centralized servers,
implemented with an unauthenticated, unencrypted, protocol - the worst
of all possible solutions with many possible MITM vectors and privacy
security holes)

To that end, I'd be inclined to leave the DNS seed protocol as it is and
let others solve the centralized server use-case, for which Cartographer
isn't all that bad of a load balancing mechanism. Also as gmaxwell noted
on IRC, adding flag bits does have privacy implications.

Any protocol change that would split blocks themselves into multiples.
Not an easy problem to solve, but given the inherent O(n^2) scaling of
global consensus blockchains, it's the only kind of solution that could
in the future make the blockchain itself have reasonable scalability.

> Anyone have the best reference for the DoS issues?

Well actually, we can reference the DoS attacks that Bitcoin XT nodes
are undergoing right now - part of the attack is repeated Bloom filter
requests to soak up disk IO bandwidth. I've CC'd Gavin and Mike - as far
as I know they haven't published details of those attacks - a write-up
would be very helpful.

While so far those are being directed only at XT nodes, obviously this
is a potential issue for Core nodes as well. Like I mentioned last time
around, it's critical that miners aren't affected by these attacks -
nodes simply serving SPV wallet clients are much less latency sensitive,
so a good DoS attack mitigation strategy would be to have the two
classes of nodes out there "in the wild"

Related I recently had a conversation with a Mycelium employee who told me
they were considering moving to spv/bloom because of the server issues
Andreas mentioned.

I don't know any more about their plans, but I wouldn't assume the above
statement to be correct.

This is a security issue: if you can find a likely scenario where the
system fails, that's a problem and we need to fix it.

You've taken the scenario where the system fails, and changed the
conditions to create a scenario where it works. That's not particularly
interesting or noteworthy.

To use a car analogy, Pieter Wuille has shown that the brake cylinders
have a fatigue problem, and if used in stop-and-go traffic regularly
they'll fail during heavy braking, potentially killing someone. You've
countered with a study of highway driving, showing that if the car is
only used on the highway the brakes have no issues, claiming that the
car design is perfectly safe.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Consensus based block size retargeting algorithm
	(draft)
Message-ID: <CADJgMzvWKA79NHE2uFy1wb-zL3sjC5huspQcaDczxTqD_7gXOg@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to offer a potential way to adjust the block size limit in a
democratic way without making it easy to game. This is meant only as a
starting point for a general idea. Thresholds and exact figures and
the details of the algorithm are up for debate, and possibly some
formula based determination.

<pre>
  BIP: XX
  Title: Consensus based block size retargeting algorithm
  Author: BtcDrak <btcdrak at gmail.com>
  Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2015-08-21
</pre>

==Abstract==

A method of altering the maximum allowed block size of the Bitcoin
protocol using a consensus based approach.

==Motivation==

There is a perception that Bitcoin cannot easily respond to raising
the blocksize limit if popularity was to suddenly increase due to a
mass adoption curve, because co-ordinating a hard fork takes
considerable time, and being unable to respond in a timely manner
would irreparably harm the credibility of bitcoin.

Additionally, predetermined block size increases are problematic
because they attempt to predict the future, and if too large could
have unintended consequences like damaging the possibility for a fee
market to develop as block subsidy decreases substantially over the
next 9 years; introducing or exacerbating mining attack vectors; or
somehow affect the network in unknown or unpredicted ways. Since fixed
changes are hard to deploy, the damage could be extensive.

Dynamic block size adjustments also suffer from the potential to be
gamed by the larger hash power.


==Rationale==

By introducing a cost to increase the block size ensures the mining
community will collude to increase it only when there is a clear
necessity, and reduce it when it is unnecessary. Rogue miners cannot
force their wishes so easily because not only will they have to pay
extra a difficulty target, then can be downvoted at no cost by the
objecting hash power.


==Specification==

The initial "base block size limit" shall be 1MB.

Miners can vote for a block size increase by signalling the proposed
percentage increase of the "base block size limit" in the coinbase
field. For the vote to be considered valid the block they mine must
meets a difficulty target which is proportionally larger than the
standard difficulty target based on the percentage increase they voted
for. If a miner does not vote, or the vote is invalid, it shall be
counted as a vote for no change.

Miners may vote the size down by signalling in the coinbase field
without paying a difficulty penalty.

Every 2016 blocks, the maximum allowed block size will be recalculated
by the average of all votes in the last 2016 blocks, i.e. sum each
vote from each block and divide by 2016 then multiply by the base
block size limit. This will redefine the base block size limit for the
next 2016 blocks.

Blocks that are larger than the calculated base block size limit are
invalid and MUST be rejected.

The maximum change up or down each retargeting period shall be limited
to 10% of the base block size limit.

The maximum block size may not increase above 8MB.

Votes shall be cast by adding the following human readable multiplier
to the coinbase string ?/BXn.nnn/? where valid votes would exist
between the ranges ?/BX0.900/? (10% decrease) and ?/BX1.100/? (10%
increase). ?/BX1.000/? would be a vote for no change. Invalid votes
will be counted as a vote for no change: ?/BX1.000/?.


==Acknowledgements==

This proposal is based on ideas and concepts derived from the writings
of Meni Rosenfeld and Gregory Maxwell.

That'd be a foolish design decision to move exclusively over; their
wallet was safe to use during the recent fork, unlike Android Wallet,
precisely because of their existing design.

In any case, regardless of whether we're wrong about the popularity
issue, I've yet to see any issues raised with implementing NODE_BLOOM
that will adversely affect such wallets - we've certainly got no
shortage of node capacity to go around.

No.  If we must play the analogy game, it was found that the car crashes
when the brakes are bad (minority hash power partitioned) the radio is
on (partitioned miners had small individual hashrate).

I checked the scenario where only the radio is on, and found the car
does not crash.

You said:

> There is a perception that Bitcoin cannot easily respond to raising
the blocksize limit if popularity was to suddenly increase

From this, my understanding is that you are operating on the principle
that "the optimum blocksize" is related to "popularity/use of Bitcoin".

It seems that others on this list instead feel that "the optimum
blocksize" is a function of "technical limitations (namely bandwidth)".
Do you acknowledge this as an irreconcilable difference in approach?

Also, I'm not sure, but your principle would seem to imply that
"outsourcing the decision to Miners" is superfluous. You are concerned
(according to you) with "not reacting to 'popularity' quickly enough",
and you are only against "predetermined increases" and "hashpower
influences" (according to you), so why not measure "popularity" directly
(by using "transaction volume" or "fees paid") and use that number to
set the blocksize?

--

However, thank you very much for actually stating a principle. Unless
one knows what a person's principle is, one *can't even check if* what
they are saying makes any sense (according to *them*), so my completely
sincere congratulations on an intelligible email.

Hi all,

Is there any client or code that currently implements BIP 100? And how will
it be deployed? WIll the initial fork be deployed in the same manner that
the max block size changes are deployed described in the bip?

Thanks

Incidentally, what's your acceptable revenue difference between a small
(1% hashing power) and large (%30 hashing power) miner, all else being
equal? (remember that we shouldn't preclude variance reduction
techniques such as p2pool and pooled-solo mode)

Equally, what kind of attacks on miners do you think we need to be able to
resist? E.g. DoS attacks, hacking, etc.

That would let me know if you're definition of "the brakes are bad"
corresponds to normal usage, or something that's not reasonable to
design for.

Interesting.

Unless I misunderstand the proposal, you would have to factor a way to deal
with miner cartel behavior. A few emails every week and the larger miners
could collude to set prices.

With that figured, then your voting proposal could be triggered by a moving
day block average which takes into account capacity for any given period,
plus a level of headroom for unexpected spikes. The issue with this is
forward planning is more important, especially when the moving average is
longer than a week.

Credit card providers and retailers use a number of factors to plan for
capacity on a regional basis. From previous years figures, long-term
weather forecasts, annual calendar events, one off events, etc. A global
currency can't use many of these tools for forward planning.

E.g. religious holidays are among the biggest events for transactions; if
we take Christmas, your proposal could work out a capacity during a quiet
period in November leading to a downward adjustment which then sees
transactions getting maxed out during the two weeks before Christmas eve.
You could then have an upward adjustment, but people stop spending on
Christmas day.

These are human factors that need to be considered.

Found it! From #bitcoin-wizards, 2013-07-16:

23:57 < petertodd> See, it'd be possible for nLockTime w/ time-based locks to create some really ugly incentives for miners to mine blocks at thelimit of the 2hr window - a timestamping chain could provide a way for nodes to at least detect that their clocks are off, especially given how peers can mess with them.
23:58 < petertodd> It's still dodgy though... I was thinking if nLockTime-by-time inclusion was based on the previous block timestamp it'd be ok, but that still leaves large miners with incentives to screw with the 2hr window, never mind how it can reduce competition if there exists clock skew in the mining nodes.

00:01 < petertodd> (remember that if this is a timestamping facility any node wanting to know the current time simply gets a nonce timestamped, and then they know what time it is!)
00:11 < Luke-Jr> I don't see how nLockTime can discourage forward-dating blocks
00:11 < Luke-Jr> and there is no 2hr window backward..
00:12 < Luke-Jr> well, I guess if miners are behaving there is <.<
00:19 < petertodd> The problem is a block being created with nTime > actual time, and the incentive is to get a head start on other miners to put, say, a high-fee nLockTime in the block you are creating.
00:21 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: but nLockTime only sets a minimum time, it cannot set a maximum
00:22 < petertodd> but that's it, if I have a 1BTC fee tx, with nLockTime expiring in two hours, why not take the increased orphan chance and set nTime on my block to two hours ahead/
00:22 < petertodd> ?
00:22 < petertodd> yet if we allow that incentive, it's very bad for consensus
00:23 < gmaxwell> ha. We can fix.
00:23 < gmaxwell> it's a soft forking fix.
00:23 < gmaxwell> use the last blocks ntime, not this one.
00:23 < Luke-Jr> is sipa's secp256k1 branch reasonably stable?
00:23 < petertodd> gmaxwell: that's what I said...
00:24 < gmaxwell> petertodd: sorry I just read the last couple lines.
00:24 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: AFAIK we already don't relay transactions with time in the future?
00:24 < gmaxwell> petertodd: well I agree. (or not even the last block? it could use the minimum time)
00:24 < petertodd> gmaxwell: The problem is, that's only a fix if mining power is well distributed, it actually makes things worse because if there is a lot of profit to be gained the miners with a lot of hashing power still have the incentive, and it's to a much greater degree. (their orphan rate is less)
00:24 < Luke-Jr> gmaxwell: the minimum time will be earlier than the last block's :p
00:25 < gmaxwell> Luke-Jr: sure, but that doesn't change it really. Presumably if people start locking in the future miners will run nodes that take what they get and selfishly horde them, creating incentives for all miners to run good collection networks.
00:25 < petertodd> Luke-Jr: sure, but there are lots of ways to learn that a tx exists
00:26 < gmaxwell> petertodd: one of the reasons that the min is important there is because (1) it's hard to advance, and (2) when you advance it you raise the difficulty.
00:26 < petertodd> gmaxwell: I was working on figuring out the expected return - the math is really ugly
00:27 < gmaxwell> petertodd: a worst case expected return may be easier.
00:27 < petertodd> gmaxwell: Worst case is easy - your block is orphaned.
00:28 < petertodd> gmaxwell: See the issue is that once I find a block, the other side needs to find two blocks to beat me. As time goes on more of the other sides hashing power will accept my from the future block as valid, so then you get the next level where the remainder needs three blocks and so on.
00:28 < petertodd> gmaxwell: Pretty sure it can't be done as a closed-form equation.
00:30 < petertodd> gmaxwell: I don't think minimum time works either, because you still get to manipulate it by creating blocks in the future, although the ability too is definitely less. If I could show you'd need >50% hashing power to do anything interesting I'd be set.
00:31 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: hmm, is block-uneconomic-utxo-creation basically just an older revision of what Gavin did in 0.8.2?
00:31 < gmaxwell> petertodd: moving the minimum time forward needs the coperation of >50% of the hashpower over the small median window.
00:32 < petertodd> Luke-Jr: It's what Gavin did but non-hardcoded. I'd emphasize the better, not the older. :P
00:32 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: will you be rebasing it despite its closed status?
00:32 < Luke-Jr> actually, what about Gavin's is hardcoded? <.<
00:33 < petertodd> gmaxwell: Yeah, but you have to assume a steady stream of these incentives.
00:33 < gmaxwell> petertodd: right, so you have some force that turns all miners into a conspiracy.
00:34 < petertodd> gmaxwell: exactly
00:34 < petertodd> gmaxwell: nLockTime by time should have never been added in the first place, but it's such a nice idea on the face of it
00:35 -!- realazthat is now known as rudeasthat
00:35 -!- rudeasthat is now known as rudest
00:35 < Luke-Jr> softfork so nLockTime requires data on what block a transaction was created at, and enforces the 10 min per block <.<
00:36 -!- rudest is now known as heh
00:36 < petertodd> Luke-Jr: ?
00:36 -!- heh is now known as realz
00:36 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: for example, if you nLockTime for 1 day from now, it also enforces 144 blocks passing too
00:37 < Luke-Jr> so block count must be >now+144 AND time must be >now+24h
00:37 < Luke-Jr> not perfect, but might help
00:37 < petertodd> Still doesn't help in the usual case where mean interval is < 10 minutes, because you're back to only caring about time.
00:38 < Luke-Jr> usual now, but not eventually
00:38 < petertodd> Right, you've solved half the problem, when measured over the entire lifespan of Bitcoin, and only approximately half. :P
00:39 < Luke-Jr> theory is so much nicer than practice <.<
00:39 < gmaxwell> I'm forgetting why this is a problem again?  If miners mine blocks early, people will just artifically inflate their times or switch to height locking.
00:39 < petertodd> The problem is you're incentivising miners to make the 2hr window for block acceptance effectively shorter.
00:39 < petertodd> Thus requiring accurate clocks for consensus.
00:39 < gmaxwell> if miners do this consistently they'll drive difficulty up too which wouldn't be in their interest.
00:39 < Luke-Jr> ^
00:40 < petertodd> gmaxwell: It's only a fixed 2hr offset, that just drives difficulty up by 0.5%
00:40 < Luke-Jr> and on top of that, you'd just end up treating nTime with a minus-2-hours :p
00:41 < Luke-Jr> if everyone does it, it's predictable.
00:41 < petertodd> More to the point for any individual miner the marginal difference if they do it is effectively zero.
00:41 < gmaxwell> consider, why why cant the 2 hour window be 24 hours?
00:41 < petertodd> Luke-Jr: But that's the problem, if everyone does it, and people respond, then you can extend the interval even further!
00:41 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: how?
00:41 < petertodd> gmaxwell: It should have been more like 24 hours in the first place...
00:42 < Luke-Jr> you don't change the 2h rule
00:42 < Luke-Jr> you just assume miner times will always be up against it
00:42 < gmaxwell> Luke-Jr: move your clock/window forward so you dont reject stupid blocks.
00:42 < petertodd> Luke-Jr: Again, the issue is the effect on *consusus*. I don't care when the tx gets mined, I care that miners are incentivised to break consunsus for anyone without NTP.
00:43 < petertodd> The problem is no matter *what* the window is, there is an incentive to mine as close to the window as possible to accept a tx sooner than your competitors.
00:43 < petertodd> It could be a week and people would still have an incentive to set nTime + 1 week - 1 second
00:44 < Luke-Jr> if nTime is future, wait until that time before relaying it? <.<
00:44 -!- realz is now known as pleasedont
00:44 < gmaxwell> and once people did that, you'd want to start accepting blocks that where nTime + 1 week because god knows you don't want to reject a block if your clock was 2 seconds slow and most hashpower accepted it.
00:44 < petertodd> About the only thing that might change that is if the rule was nLockTime > nTime of last block, and then after that being allowed to include a tx was based on H(txhash, last hash) or similar
00:45 < petertodd> gmaxwell: exactly, the fundemental issue is there is no good incentive to set nTime accurately other than miners rejecting your blocks, and nLockTime sabotages that
00:45 -!- pleasedont is now known as realzies
00:45 < petertodd> gmaxwell: (timestamping could do, but the cause->effect is less obvious)
00:45 < Luke-Jr> I guess I just incentivized always setting nTime to the minimum then
00:45 < Luke-Jr> [04:32:26] <Luke-Jr> petertodd: will you be rebasing it despite its closed status? (block-uneconomic-utxo-creation)
00:46 < petertodd> Luke-Jr: again, relaying does nothing - consider the case of nLockTime'd fidelity bonds where it's guaranteed 100% of the hashing power know (why I wrote the spec as by-block-height in the first place)
00:46 < petertodd> Luke-Jr: sure
00:46 < Luke-Jr> petertodd: I mean delaying relaying the BLOCK
00:46 < Luke-Jr> ie, increasing the risk of it being stale
00:47 < petertodd> Luke-Jr: then you have your mining pool connect directly to other mining pools playing the same game
00:47 < petertodd> you have to assume perfect information knowledge in this stuff, at least if you're writing worst-case academic papers
00:48 < gmaxwell> petertodd: so ... prior block vs minimum time.
00:48 < petertodd> see, that's why I was talking about timestamping, because it provides a way for all users to set their clocks to what the majority of hashing power thinks nTime is, sidestepping the problem
00:48 < gmaxwell> petertodd: what are your arguments there?
00:48 < petertodd> gmaxwell: minimum time is definitely stronger because it involves more hashing power
00:49 < petertodd> gmaxwell: users would prefer minimum time - easier to understand why the tx isn't getting mined
00:49 < gmaxwell> sidestepping the problem < that doesn't sidestep the problem, it would allow the majority of hashpower to mine difficulty down to 1; also moots nlocktime as _time_ being more reliable than a height.
00:49 < gmaxwell> petertodd: plus, you can just add a constant offset to your nlocktime to adjust for the expected minimum lag.
00:51 < petertodd> gmaxwell: yes, it creates a new problem, but it did sidestep the existing one :P
00:51 < gmaxwell> petertodd: yea, lol, creates an inflation attack. Keep it up and you'll be qualified to create an altcoin. :P
00:52 < gmaxwell> (sorry, hah, I'm not poking fun at you, I'm poking fun at all the altcoins that "solved the Foo problem" where foo is something no one else thinks is a problem and they totally broke security as a side effect)
00:52 < petertodd> gmaxwell: yup, now you see how it only sidesteps the problem truly when there is enough hashing power setting their clocks back, IE 50% honest, which is better
00:53 < petertodd> gmaxwell: without the timestamping, nodes have the consensus failures, which can be attacked, likely it trades off one risk for a more existential risk
00:53 < petertodd> gmaxwell: and it's a good excuse for timestamping, lol
00:54 < gmaxwell> I thin the min solves the consensus failure so long as hashpower is well distributed.
00:54 < petertodd> yeah, I'm thinking min is probably the best we can do

Had a discussion on IRC and with Pieter, and I kinda agree that the more
optimal way is for DNS seeds to, instead of returning NODE_NETWORK
nodes, return any node which responds to getaddr, allowing clients to
connect to a few DNS seeds by name, do a getaddr, then disconnect (like
Bitcoin Core does now if you're using Tor). They can then select the
peers they want based on nServices.

Meh, whatever, justification is already provided well enough without
having to go into "but if we did this long into the future"  arguments.

Ehh, I was going more for the oldest mention.

Security vulnerabilities related to the Litecoin v0.8.3.6 release
=================================================================

Nonce: c0854ae01b1ed8526af3bb6fb82550ff
Date:  Jul 29 2013

To be released in full on January 29, 2014 to the public.


LevelDB
=======

Something not well appreciated outside of the Bitcoin developers is that the
temporary limits on block size and complexity introduced in response to the
fork, automatically removed on May 15th, were simply voluntary measures to
protect against accidental triggering of the fork. The measures did not protect
against malicious attempts to trigger the the fork.

Litecoin is no different. Because of that I strongly recomend that miners be
encouraged to transition to v0.8.3.6 as soon as possible to ensure as much
hashing power as possible is consolidated on one version. Transitioning for
users/merchants is also important, however with sufficient mining power on the
new version it would be difficult to pull off a double-spend attack against an
older version simply because it would take so long to get the required number
of confirmations.

The development team may want to clarify this point to the Litecoin community
and encourage users to be suspicious if it takes an especially long time to get
confirmations. Merchants with automatic systems should use fail-safes triggered
by unusually long confirmation times, and as always ensure that total possible
losses are limited. It would be good if popular "blockchain information" sites
upgraded to v0.8.3.6 along with miners to give users accurate information on
the state of the blockchain. In any case users and merchants should take this
advice in general regardless of specific threats.

I would not be surprised to see someone deliberately attempt to fork Litecoin
by exploiting the issue; there is a lot of hostility torwards and within the
alt-coins.


SPV and network-wide DoS attacks
================================

Bitcoin is quite vulnerable currently to network-wide DoS attacks due to the
maximum connections limits; we do not have any form of filtering on incoming
connections so an attack can be made simply by making sufficient connections to
all nodes that they hit that incoming connections limit. This is public
knowledge, as is the suggestion to stop the attack by having concepts of peer
"usefullness" so that "useless" peers can be dropped. Of course SPV nodes are
badly impacted by such measures.

What isn't as well-known publicly is that Litecoin will make this attack
significantly less costly to the attacker in v0.8.3.6 by adding support for
bloom filters. That support allows the attacker to reduce their bandwidth
consumption to a minimum, making the attack easier to pull off on a wide scale.

The Bitcoin team is aware of the issue. Our plans in the event of an attack are
to ensure that large pools and merchants connect to each other via a private
"darknet" while fixes are implemented. These plans are also useful in the event
of an attack exploiting the vulnerability discussed below.


Bloom filters and disk IO
=========================

However it gets worse: there is nothing limiting peers from requesting blocks.
Without bloom filters bandwidth is a natural limit, however with bloom filters
a malicious peer can simply set the filter to match almost nothing and simply
submit getdata messages to the target requesting all blocks. The target will do
an extremely large amount of disk IO at almost no cost to the attacker.

To quote one core developer in a private conversation regarding bloom filtering
"I think we didn't think hard enough before implementing this"

A good first measure would be to assign a service bit to advertise bloom filter
support:

 /** nServices flags */
 enum
 {
     NODE_NETWORK = (1 << 0),
+    NODE_BLOOM_FILTER = (1 << 1),
 };

Secondly add a command line switch that allows bloom filtering to be turned on
or off entirely. I would suggest that the next version of Litecoin be released
soon and have bloom filters *disabled* by default unless the user specifically
turns them on.

There is a *very* good chance of an attack being launched targetting this
vulnerability by people using it as a way to show their opinion of Mike Hearn;
lots of people strongly dislike him for what they regard as very poor judgement
on security and scalability issues and would be happy to show that a design he
promoted is flawed.

Disabling bloom filering does of course cause problems for SPV clients, however
in the Litecoin realm such clients are non-existent. In the long run DNS seeds
should allow for the specification of desired service bits and rate limiting of
getdata operations implemented. However given that attacks are likely imminent
I strongly suggest a quick solution.

Bitcoin should have done bloom filtering as a service bit on day one; not doing
so was a mistake.

The Bitcoin team is aware of this issue. Please contact me to discuss the
release process for a fix; I will also be happy to review it. Unfortunately due
to the impact on SPV clients this issue is political as well as technical on
the Bitcoin side of things.


CHECKMULTISIG dummy value
=========================

The AreInputsStandard() test does not check the contents of the dummy value
required to spend a BIP11 CHECKMULTISIG scriptPubKey; anything that be put in
that space as a way to get data into the blockchain. Less well appreciated is
that because scriptSigs are unsigned any node, even a non-miner, can change the
txid of a CHECKMULTISIG transaction by modifying the dummy value.

This issue will probably be fixed in Bitcoin soon, not to mention revealed
publically; I'm only including it for the sake of completeness.

Bitcoin will be neutered and die if the big Chinese mining pools
utilize XT.

Specifically the text of @JihanWu's tweet was,

"I support increasing the block size. @BITMAINtech 's AntPool will be
prepared to switch to XT, IF we see majority has switched."

Since there are many people who are supportive of increasing the block
size, but have spend much time calling attention to the many problems
of XT (which I need not repeat again here), it is odd that Jihan Wu
would see a need to suggest that AntPool will be prepared to switch to
XT at a time when there has not yet been time for fully assessing
other proposals; not all proposals have gone through a voting process,
nor have even people had a chance yet to attend upcoming workshops on
the subject which are partially or wholly intended for development of
consensus ( one example being the upcoming one in Montreal, but I
think this is not the only one https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/
).
See also Pindar Wong's post on this list regarding the Montreal workshop
:
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/0101
35.html

This is also a good time to remember again some of the pressures being
placed by the state on Chinese internet-based businesses.  These
pressures have increased, as has been recently discussed on this list,
here:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/0098
61.html

Take a good read of these issues (linked to above) relating to Chinese
mining and the influence of the Chinese state, and it becomes clear
how the state pressures might cause Chinese miners to adopt XT in
light of:

Hearn's disabling Tor in XT
https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007167.html
http://cointelegraph.com/news/115153/bitcoin-xt-fork-can-blacklist-tor-e
xits-may-reveal-users-ip-addresses
Hearn's move to support blacklisting
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qmbtu/mike_hearn_chair_of_the
_bitcoin_foundations_law/

A recent post that sums it up pretty well:
http://qntra.net/2015/08/collected-notes-on-the-xt-client-and-xtcoin-for
k/

I encourage people still reading this list to:

- - Not use XT
- - Work to develop consensus on an alternative that increases block
size (e.g. BIP 100)
- - Attend a conference if you can such as the one which is coming up in
Montreal https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/ and if you go there
as a developer / engineer / miner, AGREE ON SOMETHING (other than XT)
- - Visualize different proposals and votes on them so people can see
what is happening
- - Please see also (how end users can deal with this situation) at:
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1157545.msg12189776
and contribute to the discussion if you like

Thank you.

Actually no. I thought revenue would be a less subjective question to ask, with more focus on the underlying orphan rate question; part of the answer might include an assumed profit margin.

Hello,

In response to public and private comments and feedback, we have updated
this working draft.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwEbhrQ4ELzBOUVtOHJQdlhvUmc/view?usp=sharing

Update highlights:

1. Specific clarifications on replacing the Coinbase subsidy and
supplementing *and* not replacing transaction fees.

2. Clarification on block chain overhead. The value of data mining is on a
bell curve, so year six data will be removed every year.

3. Added references to an ability to create global, national and regional
Bitcoin Price Indices for popular baskets of goods transacted with Bitcoin.

4. Added references for an ability to use structured block chain data for
Bitcoin capacity and fork planning.

5. Removed references to price speculation.

6. Added preferences for deployment dates of January 2017 or January 2018.

7. Moving towards BIP format after discussion and evaluation period.

I do want something better, but not for the focus you have.

Not because what you produce was not high quality, but because quality is achieved at a very
high cost and is hard to uphold over generations of developer. You focus on a single use case
while there are many out there for distributed ledgers.

I think in an infrastructure for enterprise applications, building consensus on the ledger is a
cornerstone there, but is only a piece of the solution. I built several commercially successful
deployments where I delegated the consensus building to a border router, a Bitcoin Core,
then interfaced that trusted peer with my  implementation that accepted Core?s decisions
in an SPV manner. One might think of this setup as wasteful and unsuitable for ?small devices?
therefore an example of centralization people here try to avoid.

Enterprises have sufficient resources. Solving the business problem is valuable to them even at
magnitudes higher cost than a hobbyist would bear.

For mainstream adoption you need to get enterprises on board too, and  that is what I care of.
Enterprises want code that is not only high quality, but is easy to maintain with a development
team with high attrition. One has to take whatever help is offered for that, and one is modern
languages and runtimes.

Bits of Proof?s own implementation of the scripts was not practically relevant in my commercially
successful deployments, because of the use of a border router, but it helped development,
enabling easier debug and precise error feedback esp. end even after Core had a reject message.

I integrated libconsensus only for the hope that is significantly fastens application side tx verification,
 which it has turned out it does not, until secp265k1 is integrated.

I would likely use an other extended libconsensus too, but do not think there was a dependency on
that for enterprise development.

It would help there more to have a slim protocol server, no wallet, no rpc, no qt but a high
performance remoting API.

Storage and validation is non-trivially interconnected, but I now the separation can be done,
since I did it.

Excuse me, but function pointers is a pattern I used in the 80?s. I know that they are behind
the curtain of modern abstractions with similar use, I still prefer not to see them again.

I am not sure that this is on-topic for the bitcoin-dev mailing list, but
it seems politically relevant enough that I'm going to respond.

/r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org are both discussion websites that pertain to
a specific topic. All (or nearly all) discussion websites pertaining to a
specific topic have a set of rules that get enforced to facilitate relevant
and interesting discussion. These rules help to block spam, and help to
make sure that discussions happen in their appropriate places. The rules in
place on the two primary bitcoin discussion sites have helped facilitate a
large userbase frequented by many relevant experts. I do believe that we
can thank the strict moderation policies for much of the activity that
happens which is technically interesting.

/r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org are both centralized forums. As such, the
rules are going to be set by a centralized authority. The rules set have
been set to keep the discussion as interesting and relevant as possible.
When a certain theme becomes a massive echo chamber or little more than
beating a dead horse, it makes sense to implement moderation. Calling it
'censorship' is misleading, because a government authority is not
threatening punishment for the discussion of a certain topic. People are
not banned from visiting forums or websites where off-topic (or
against-the-rules) discussion is happening. People's /r/bitcoin rights are
not being revoked because they are subscribed to a controvertial subreddit.
That would be censorship.

Many people are clearly unhappy with the moderation happening on /r/bitcoin
and bitcointalk.org. Luckily, the switching cost for online discussion
forums is very low. I'm now going to invite people to post links to bitcoin
discussion forums where the moderation authority is different.

I know that a recently popular subreddit is /r/bitcoin_uncensored

I am interested to see what other forums people think are worth mentioning.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size possible solution - to set minimum size
Message-ID: <CALNn0ZZ5gY6R7gzpLpbNnFecAz35ZqaLx_RNPxx=SoJTAdHDXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
As I understand the main problem of the fork Core<->XT is possibility
of double spending:
-I run XT and spend my coins
-it is written in 8mb block
-Core does not accept this block
-I run Core and spend my coins again
-it is written in 1mb block
-but XT accepts this block too
so
-in the XT blockchain both blocks [8] and [1] contain my coins

I thought that possible solution can be to set minimum block size
i.e.
2016: 1mb <= blockSize < 2mb
2017: 2mb <= blockSize < 3mb
2018: 3mb <= blockSize < 4mb
etc

Free space could be filled with zeroes and compressed.

That's all, just an idea.


With Best Regards

I've been pushing for greater modularization since I first got into
bitcoin. I got quickly frustrated when I was only able to get through very
few things (i.e. moving core structure serialization classes to a separate
unit not called main). Working on Bitcoin has an added layer of frustration
that goes beyond most open source projects: even though we're clearly in
userland working at the application layer, a good layered protocol design
is still lacking. We have no standards process separate from what basically
amount to updates to one specific reference implementation. And we all need
to agree on any major change, since a blockchain that is easily forked in
contentious ways pretty much defeats its own purpose.

I went off to develop my own stack, where I could more easily avoid
politics and focus on engineering. But I now understand the politics are
inevitable. Bitcoin is inherently a cooperative project. Several people
have poured themselves passionately into the reference codebase, most of
whom did it (at least initially) purely as unpaid volunteers. There's a lot
of love that's gone into this. But it's become pretty clear that the
modularization is no longer merely a matter of good engineering - it is
essential to resolving serious political challenges.

Perhaps the most frustrating thing of all is watching people pushing for
relatively superficial yet highly controversial changes while we still lack
the proper infrastructure to handle these kinds of divergences of opinion
without either stagnating or becoming polarized.

I could continue working to reimplement an entire stack from scratch, as
several others have also done - but besides the serious effort duplication
this entails, it doesn't really seem like it will ultimately be a
convergent process. It's too easy to let ego and habit dictate one's
preferences rather than rational engineering considerations.

I know that some might feel I'm just preaching to the choir, but we should
probably take a step back from implementation hackery and try to specify
some core protocol layers, focusing on interfaces. Specifically, we need a
consensus layer that doesn't try to specify networking, storage, wallets,
UI, etc. Let different people improve upon these things independently in
their own implementations. What matters is that we all converge on a common
history and state. At the same time, let's open up more competition on all
these other things that are separate from the consensus layer.

If only we were to dedicate a fraction of the effort we've put into this
whole block size circus into what's actually important...and I blame myself
as well...

One thing it occurs to me (and I don't know if this has been suggested
before) we could do is separate the BIP process into at several distinct
areas:

1) Commit structure changes/consensus rule change proposals
- Consensus-building process (how are proposals debated, improved, vetted,
and selected)
- Update/deployment mechanisms for rule changes
- Specific hard fork proposals
- Specific soft fork proposals

2) Peer policies
- Seeding and discovery mechanisms
- Relay policies
- p2p message support

3) RPC

4) Everything else

A minimum block size does nothing to prevent the problems that come
from schism hardforks.
But also a minimum block size can be trivially cheated as recently
explained on this list:

https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010317.html

"[...] miners can just pay to themselves to follow the minimum size
block rule without risking anything.
As long as they have a single matured satoshi they can just pay to
themselves with it as many times as they need in the same block."

It is good to search previous post before proposing or asking
something (it could have been proposed/asked earlier):

I see the huge amount of sweat and love that went into core and it actually hurts to see that most is expended in friction and lack of a vision for the software architecture.

To be concrete, this was my plan if dealing with the Core code base:

1) I'd consider the separation of networking and storage as suggested for a future extended libconsensus low priority, as their design should be (are) dominated by the need of the consensus logic only.

2) create an API to the consensus+networking+storage service that is not at the C++ language level but some scaleable cross-platform remoting, like eg. ZeroMQ.
This API should be minimal and simple, assuming that one fully trusts the node answering it. This API would unlock user land development by distinct teams with diverse technologies.

3) move the wallet, QT and RPC and other backward compatibility stuff (if e.g. there is some mining support) in-top of the new API and into distinct source code repositories.

I got quickly frustrated when I was only able to get through very few things (i.e. moving core structure serialization classes to a separate unit not called main). Working on Bitcoin has an added layer of frustration that goes beyond most open source projects: even though we're clearly in userland working at the application layer, a good layered protocol design is still lacking. We have no standards process separate from what basically amount to updates to one specific reference implementation. And we all need to agree on any major change, since a blockchain that is easily forked in contentious ways pretty much defeats its own purpose.

Several people have poured themselves passionately into the reference codebase, most of whom did it (at least initially) purely as unpaid volunteers. There's a lot of love that's gone into this. But it's become pretty clear that the modularization is no longer merely a matter of good engineering - it is essential to resolving serious political challenges.

What matters is that we all converge on a common history and state. At the same time, let's open up more competition on all these other things that are separate from the consensus layer.

This is off-topic here.
Consensus critical changes (those aren't changes that Bitcoin Core
developers can make unilaterally against the will of alternative
implementations or users) and Bitcoin Core development are independent
from bitcointalk.org and /r/bitcoin.
And as you say, people can create competing without moderation or
"censorship" (ie /r/bitcoin_uncensored or bitcontalkuncensred.org
/r/bitcoin_moderated_by_someone_else ).

I apologize, I'm not familiar with technical details, may be stupid,
only general thoughts:
-overlapped block sizes - two blockchains, uncertainty, unpredictable
results, trust gets down
-non-overlapped - single blockchain, determined growing, everybody
knows the schedule what and when will happen

---

You wrote "cheated",
but why?
If it will be possible to fill with zeroes
[transactions]+[zeroes]
or
[transactions]+[miner's dummy transactions]
why the second variant will be better for miner?
and why it will be not good for other users?

Some comments:

"(i) remove any possibility of free transactions unless

associated with basic transaction data;"

I believe it is not possible to prevent free transactions for the
reason that people can pay out of band (via existing banking transfers
to miners) or make payments to addresses belonging to miners (that are
contingent on the requested user transaction being processed via input
dependency) .


I am not sure I fully understand the way you see monetisation working,
and you do indicate this is quite far future what-if stage idea, and
you do identify a conflict with fungibility - but I think this is
probably quite badly in conflict with fungibility to the point of
conflicting with many planned Bitcoin improvements?  And mid term
technical directions.

I would say the long term idealised requirements are that the
transaction itself would have cryptographic fungibility, and policy
relating to identity for authorisation, approval in regulated
transactions would take place at the payment protocol layer.  The
payment protocol is already seeing some use.

Lightning protocol sees more of the data going point to point and so
not broadcast nor visible for big data analytic monetisation.

9. 0.328125 BTC to "OP_8 OP_CSV"
10. 0.328125 BTC to "OP_9 OP_CSV"

The first output will fill up the size to 1MB.

This tx could not be confirmed by a pre-hardfork miner because the 
coinbase tx will consume some block space. The first big block miner 
will be able to collect 66BTC of fee. The block confirming the first big 
block will collect 42BTC of fee, etc. This will create a long enough 
chain to bootstrap the hardfork.

The amount is chosen to make sure the difference is <25BTC, so miners 
would have less incentive to create a fork instead of confirming other's 
block. However, a miner cartel may launch a 51% attack to collect all 
money. Such incentive may be reduced by adjusting the distribution of 
donation. (Actually, such cartel may be formed anytime, just for 
collecting more block reward)

While I like the idea of voting on the block size debate...  Why is this
vote limited to miners only?

I would prefer to see a vote by owners/holders of bitcoin, not miners of
bitcoin.

If miners with 10%+ hashrate are the only ones who get to vote... bitcoin
development is an oligarchy

My 2cents

That guy is going to easily make back his 150 BTC with interest, if he
is short BTC. Should be a clear signal for the market to trend lower,
probably below $180 by the time of the test.

None of this is in the scope of Pieter's simulation.

If you think that casts doubt on my conclusions, then it casts doubt on
his original conclusions as well.

I can't follow this logic. Can you help?  The existing semantics, to
the extent that they exist at all is that the earliest version starts
with the lowest sequence number then counts up (and if it makes its
way to the highest number, the result is final-- because it could go
no higher).

Thats the semantics 'the inversion' accomplishes for CSV: the that the
first version of a transaction begins with a smaller number which
successful versions increase, and the highest possible number is final
(no delay, because no delay is the shortest delay).


Seperately, to Mark and Btcdrank: Adding an extra wrinkel to the
discussion has any thought been given to represent one block with more
than one increment?  This would leave additional space for future
signaling, or allow, for example, higher resolution numbers for a
sharechain commitement.

No, I don't think anybody thought about this. I just explained this to
Pieter using "for example, 10 instead of 1".
He suggested 600 increments so that it is more similar to timestamps.

As far as I know, "his conclusions" were that there was an effect,
while suspending judgement on whether that effect was high enough to
be important for a given size or not.

A power of 2 would be far more efficient here. The key question is how long
of a relative block time do you need? Figure out what the maximum should be
( I don't know what that would be, any ideas?) and then see how many bits
you have left over.

I think this comment is more related to BIP68 instead of OP_CSV? Without 
further complicating the BIP68, I believe the best way to leave room for 
improvement is to spend a bit in tx nVersion to indicate the activation 
of BIP68. I have raised this issue before with 
http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010043.html 
However, it seems Mark isn't in favor of my proposal

The idea is not to permanently change the meaning of nSequence. 
Actually, BIP68 is "only enforced if the most significant bit of the 
sequence number field is set." So BIP68 is optional, anyway. All I 
suggest is to move the flag from nSequence to nVersion. However, this 
will leave much bigger room for using nSequence for other purpose in the 
future.

AFAIK, nSequence is the only user definable and signed element in TxIn. 
There could be more interesting use of this field and we should not 
change its meaning permanently. (e.g. if nSequence had 8 bytes instead 
of 4 bytes, it could be used to indicate the value of the input to fix 
this problem: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=181734.0 )

Sorry this was meant for the list:

There are only 32 bits in the version field. If you're going to spend a bit
for perpetuity to indicate whether or not a feature is active, you'd better
have a good reason to make that feature optional.

I haven't seen a compelling use case for having BIP 68 be optional in that
way. As you note, BIP 68 semantics is already optional by toggling the most
significant bit, and that doesn't permanently burn a version bit.

Your proposal also permanently burns a sequence bit. It depends on how 
we value a nSequence bit and a nVersion bit. I think there is a 
trade-off here:

1. nSequence is signed by each TxIn individually, while all TxIns must 
share the same nVersion

2. If nVersion is used to indicate the meaning of nSequence (as I 
suggested):
Pros:
It saves a nSequence bit and allows more space for redefining the 
nSequence
Cons:
It burns a nVersion bit.
All TxIns in a tx must share the same meaning for their nSequence

3. If nSequence is used to indicate the meaning of itself (as you 
suggested):
Pros:
It saves a nVersion bit
Different TxIn may have different meaning with their nSequence
Cons:
It burns a nSequence bit, thus less space for extension

I don't think there is a perfect choice. However, I still prefer my 
proposal because:

1. nSequence is signed by each TxIn individually and could be more 
interesting than nVersion.
2. If nVersion is expected to be a monotonic number, 2 bytes = 65536 
versions is enough for 65 millenniums if it ticks once per year. 4 bytes 
is an overkill. Why don't we spend a bit if there is a good reason? Most 
softforks (e.g. OP_CLTV, OP_CSV, BIP66) are not optional. These kind of 
optional new functions would not be common and should never use up the 
version bits. (or, could you suggest a better use of the tx version 
bits?)

Adam,

Thank you for your comments. We will address them in the next update.

Privacy is an area you have been championing for many years and your input
in this area has created the environment for Bitcoin to exist. Anonymity is
not something we would be willing to compromise, despite the general
public's endless willingness to give away their intimate life histories and
contact details to Facebook and other social media.

If you have the will to read a longish response, we have tried to expand a
little on the rationale for the type of data we believe will be useful and
valuable, in addition to broadly addressing the privacy issues.

Arguably, the greater the cryptographic protections on the ownership of a
transaction, the more value will be placed on the nature of transactions.
Without wishing to frame the conversation on specifics or particular
sectors, here are some distinctions to address some of the previously noted
Orwellian fears on attaching identity markers to Bitcoin transactions.

* We have no desire to create tools that can analyze which brand of baked
beans Bob may prefer compared to Alice. That is a matter of extreme detail
for supermarkets, their suppliers and internal point of sale systems.  When
you make a store purchase, your basket of goods are wrapped up in a single
payment which appears on your credit card or bank statement. Knowing on an
aggregated basis that people spend around $120 / week on retail shopping
and that Saturday is the busiest period for that activity is more valuable
for payment processors than knowing the contents of Bob's basket of goods.

As a retailer or supplier, I would buy that data in order to plan
inventory, marketing budgets, promotional activity, staffing levels,
logistics, factory production, bank borrowing, store expansion planning,
etc.

* Now consider petrol. Bitcoin is very well suited for fuel purchases,
especially for small independent petrol filling stations. Aggregated data
would help the entire supply chain that serves the consumer, if businesses
at the front end had access to data for when demand was at peaks and
troughs. Extend that from individual petrol stations to regional, national
and international consumer purchases and you have the basis of the market
pricing oil based on demand per period and per country. Again, we don't
care that it is actually Bob who fills up every Sunday so he has enough
fuel to last him the week or to track him along his driving holiday.

* Now consider remittances. While the global headlines are that it is a
$500bn a year industry. Few people know that remittances are based on a
relatively small number of remittance corridors that make up the bulk of
the market.  These corridors are based around people leaving small towns
and villages in poor areas and travelling to work in locations based on
knowing someone or a family member who used to live in their area and are
doing well in xyz location because they can see the beneficial impact on
the recipients quality of life. At the coal face, remittances are a word of
mouth grey market sector and part of the reason that WU and the like can
charge so much is because the last mile of remittances are in areas where
monetary infrastructure and logistics are difficult to serve and they can
get away with setting high prices. They prosper because they use data to
organise themselves better. Banks have no desire to serve this market
because you end up clogging up branches every Friday or Saturday with
people that transact relatively small sums compared to those that are
banked and get annoyed waiting. Having access to Bitcoin transaction data
on this sector would help Bitcoin businesses to understand the end points
of this market and serve it better and focus their promotional activities.
We have no desire to identify that Bob's cousin Jos? is working illegally
in Texas.

These are three sectors where there are millions of small businesses that
would, for the first time, be able to access global, national and regional
industry data figures typically reserved for large businesses due to the
high cost of acquiring or commissioning research.

While increasing anonymity or having zero knowledge proofs in transactions
is desirable so that I can keep my Bitcoin salary payments private and my
membership of Ashley Madison out of the news, it would be helpful to know
that when I want to spend my salary that the world around me is organised
enough to serve my needs.

The block chain is ledger. It will contain a global data set that could end
up being one of the most valuable databases in the world. Why not use it to
fund Bitcoin's security infrastructure and growing bandwidth challenges?

Regards,

Ahmed

Great questions.

- Currently working on technical BIP draft and implementation, hopefully
for ScalingBitcoin.org.  Only the PDF is publicly available as of today.
- Yes, the initial deployment is in the same manner as size votes.

So, to summarize, someone is attacking Mike Hearn's bitcoin fork. 
Therefore, now is the perfect time to write a BIP and author changes
that begin the process of dropping support for the most broadly
successful class of wallets, which Mike Hearn's SPV client library enables.

NACK: stated rationales are invalid: both privacy and DoS (see below for
experimental data).


1 - Bloom filtering doesn't add privacy for node operators, it adds privacy
for lightweight wallets. And in fact, with a high FP rate it does do that.
Most users want both low bandwidth usage *and* query scrambling, which is
harder to do but not impossible. There is a clear roadmap for how to
implement that with smarter clients: no protocol changes are needed.

So the first stated rationale is spurious: disabling Bloom filtering
doesn't improve privacy for anyone. It can only hurt.



2 - SPV usage is rising, not falling.

Peter's data is flawed because he ignored the fact that SPV clients tend to
connect, sync, then disconnect. They don't remain connected all the time.
So merely examining a random snapshot of what's connected at a single point
in time will give wildly varying and almost random results.

A more scientifically valid approach is to check the number of actual
connections over a long span of time. Here's the data from my node:

mike at plan99:~/.bitcoin$ grep -Po 'receive version message: ([^:]*):'
debug.log |sort |uniq -c|sort -n|tac|head -n 10
  11027 receive version message: /getaddr.bitnodes.io:
   6264 receive version message: /bitcoinseeder:
   4944 receive version message: /bitcoinj:
   2531 receive version message: /Snoopy:
   2362 receive version message: /breadwallet:
   1127 receive version message: /Satoshi:
    204 receive version message: /Bitcoin XT:
    128 receive version message: /BitCoinJ:
     97 receive version message: /Bither1.3.8/:
     82 receive version message: /Bitaps:

Once crawlers are removed, SPV wallets (bitcoinj, breadwallet) make up the
bulk of all P2P clients. This is very far from 1% and falling, as Todd
wrongly suggests.



3 - It is said that there is a DoS attack possible. This claim does not
seem to have been researched.

I decided to test it out for real, so I implemented a DoS attack similar to
the one we've seen against XT nodes: it sends getdata for large (1mb)
filtered blocks over and over again as fast as possible.

As was reported and makes sense, CPU usage goes to 100%. However I couldn't
see any other effects. RPCs still react immediately, the Qt GUI is fully
responsive, I was even able to sync another SPV client to that node and it
proceeded at full speed. It's actually pretty nice to see how well it held
up.

Most importantly transactions and blocks continued to be relayed without
delay. I saw my VPS node receive a block only eight seconds after my local
node, which is well within normal propagation delays.

There's another very important point here: I profiled my local node whilst
it was under this attack. It turns out that Bloom filtering is extremely
fast. 90% of the CPU time is spent on loading and deserializing the data
from disk. Only 10% of the CPU time was spent actually filtering.

Thus you can easily trigger exactly the same DoS attack by just using
regular getdata requests on large blocks over and over. You don't need
Bloom filtering. If you don't want to actually download the blocks just
don't TCP ACK the packets and then FIN after a few seconds .... the data
will all have been loaded and be sitting in the send buffers.

So even if I refine the attack and find a way to actually deny service to
someone, the fix would have to apply to regular non-filtered block fetches
too, which cannot be disabled.


In summary: this BIP doesn't solve anything, but does create a big upgrade
headache.

But is this useful without having decided on a way to signal which blocks pruned nodes do have?

It looks like the part between paranthesis is speculation and should be left to a future BIP.

Pie charts are a poor tool to visualize data.

Its more of a statement of "in the future, we expect things to happen
which would make this an interesting thing to do, so we state here that
it is not against spec to do so". Could reword it as "NODE_BLOOM is
distinct from NODE_NETWORK, and it is legal to advertise NODE_BLOOM but

I'll just quote what I said on github:

Neither this pull nor the BIP has any stated intention of phasing out
bloom filtering support in the protocol. As much as I'd love to, I 100%
agree with @mikehearn here, that would break any ability of SPV clients
to operate on the P2P network (either as a way to double-check
centralized servers, or otherwise), and that is really not a good idea
without a replacement in place. This pull/BIP DOES suggest we phase out
REQUIRED bloom filtering support in the protocol - thereby fixing the
peer selection of SPV clients in the face of btcd with some flags/many
patched versions of Core/etc peers, providing a remedy for a potential
DoS attack, etc.

Yes, it makes sense to not explicitly exclude it.

When I was working on mSIGNA I became a little torn on the whole filtering
mechanism. I fully support connection filtering...but in practice always
run my own full node instances to connect to due to the three fatal flaws:
1) no mechanism for short proofs of tx nonexclusion, txout unspentness,
block validity, nor the ability to find the first instance of the use of a
scriptPubKey without full blockchain scanning, 2) poor privacy, 3) lack of
incentives to run servers.

I always felt that BIP37 was necessarily a step towards a client/server
architecture.

Having said that, I have found the filter mechanism useful, if only because
no "special" server is required. However, in practice I'd rather make the
distinction between trustless peers and a client/server model more explicit.

It would be very useful to not only be able to switch filtering on and off
globally...but to be able to switch on a per-connection basis. But then
again, perhaps it would be smarter to ditch the whole bloom filter thing in
favor of an actual client/server architecture with proper authentication
and access controls.

The RPC was supposed to be this client/server architecture...but in
practice it sucks so bad for doing anything beyond administering a node
instance you fully control yourself that I eschewed it entirely in my
wallet design.

I'm not sure what your reasoning for this is? If your concern is that
someone starts DoS attacking you with bloom-based attacks, you should
just disconnect them as an attacker, and announce that you support bloom
filtering globally. If you want to serve your own nodes, then I dont
think this BIP doesnt allow you to do so, just needs an implementation.

You don't necessarily need to send everyone the same nServices bits.
E.g. you could give whitelisted peers special privileges.

But only advertize the intersection of your supported services (eg those you offer to the general public) in `addr` messages.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Splitting BIPs
Message-ID: <CABr1YTcoWesaBJaT--bbUUN-c2phc-=3ieWT7vVDNPGg0iHH2g@mail.gmail.com>

Seems like a lot of effort and goodwill is being wasted on contention over
things we don't really need to agree upon. In order to help us better
prioritize, I propose adding an extra attribute to BIPs indicating their
"level" which is split into five as follows:

1. Consensus (hard/soft fork)
2. Peer Services
3. RPC
4. Implementations
5. Applications

I posted an example of what such a table might look like here: http://
blockhawk.net/bitcoin-dev/bipwiki.html

If other folks also think this is a good idea I'll start working on a BIP
draft for this.

Also, the current "type" attribute needs modification. There are different
degrees of "standard". Just because a lot of people do X doesn't need to
mean that doing X is "officially" endorsed by any other devs. At most
levels below 1, disagreements might be entirely tolerable for many things.

Yes, the two dimensions are orthogonal: BIP 100 support and actual size
voting. However there seem to be a few pools which simply vote to support
BIP100, without specifying a desired block size [1], hence I started
tracking both on the same chart, maybe I'll split them into different
charts to clarify.

Chris

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap
	[BIP 1xx - Draft]
Message-ID: <CAED3CWipF8u5g3LUrqfyHxvEk4Lu+d12ZOJZnoBUw6iZZOg-ZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Github: https://github.com/UpalChakraborty/bips/blob/master/BIP-DynamicMaxBlockSize.mediawiki

<pre>
  BIP: 1xx
  Title: Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap
  Author: Upal Chakraborty <bitcoin at upalc.com>
  Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2015-08-24
</pre>

==Abstract==

This BIP proposes replacing the fixed one megabyte maximum block size
with a dynamically controlled maximum block size that may increase or
decrease with difficulty change depending on various network factors.
I have two proposals regarding this...

i. Depending only on previous block size calculation.

ii. Depending on previous block size calculation and previous Tx fee
collected by miners.

==Motivation==

With increased adoption, transaction volume on bitcoin network is
bound to grow. If the one megabyte max cap is not changed to a
flexible one which changes itself with changing network demand, then
adoption will hamper and bitcoin's growth may choke up. Following
graph shows the change in average block size since inception...
https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-block-size?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=

==Specification==

===Proposal 1 : Depending only on previous block size calculation===

  If more than 50% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the
last difficulty period, is more than 90% MaxBlockSize
      Double MaxBlockSize
  Else if more than 90% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of
the last difficulty period, is less than 50% MaxBlockSize
      Half MaxBlockSize
  Else
      Keep the same MaxBlockSize

===Proposal 2 : Depending on previous block size calculation and
previous Tx fee collected by miners===

  TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty = Sum of all Block size of
first 2008 blocks in last 2 difficulty period
  TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty = Sum of all Block size of second
2008 blocks in last 2 difficulty period (This actually includes 8
blocks from last but one difficulty)

  TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty = Sum of all Tx fees of first 2008
blocks in last 2 difficulty period
  TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty = Sum of all Tx fees of second 2008
blocks in last 2 difficulty period (This actually includes 8 blocks
from last but one difficulty)

  If ( ( (Sum of first 4016 block size in last 2 difficulty
period)/4016 > 50% MaxBlockSize) AND (TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty >
TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty) AND (TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty
> TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty) )
      MaxBlockSize = TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty * MaxBlockSize /
TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty
  Else If ( ( (Sum of first 4016 block size in last 2 difficulty
period)/4016 < 50% MaxBlockSize) AND (TotalTxFeeInLastDifficulty <
TotalTxFeeInLastButOneDifficulty) AND (TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty
< TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty) )
      MaxBlockSize = TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty * MaxBlockSize /
TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty
  Else
      Keep the same MaxBlockSize

==Rationale==

These two proposals have been derived after discussion on
[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1154536.0 BitcoinTalk] and
[http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010285.html
bitcoin-dev mailing list]. The original idea and its evolution in the
light of various arguements can be found
[http://upalc.com/maxblocksize.php here].

===Proposal 1 : Depending only on previous block size calculation===

This solution is derived directly from the indication of the problem.
If transaction volume increases, then we will naturally see bigger
blocks. On the contrary, if there are not enough transaction volume,
but maximum block size is high, then only few blocks may sweep the
mempool. Hence, if block size is itself taken into consideration, then
maximum block size can most rationally be derived. Moreover, this
solution not only increases, but also decreases the maximum block
size, just like difficulty.

===Proposal 2 : Depending on previous block size calculation and
previous Tx fee collected by miners===

This solution takes care of stable mining subsidy. It will not
increase maximum block size, if Tx fee collection is not increasing
and thereby creating a Tx fee pressure on the market. On the other
hand, though the block size max cap is dynamically controlled, it is
very difficult to game by any party because the increase or decrease
of block size max cap will take place in the same ratio of average
block size increase or decrease.

==Compatibility==

This is a hard-forking change to the Bitcoin protocol; anybody running
code that fully validates blocks must upgrade before the activation
time or they will risk rejecting a chain containing
larger-than-one-megabyte blocks.

number at which difficulty will change.

Proposal 1 looks good, but tx fee collected can be manipulated by
miners. I like the idea next block collect the tx fee from previous
block.

This BIP has been assigned BIP112 by the BIP repository maintainer. I
have updated the pull request accordingly.

Regarding the suggestion to cannibalise version, by your own
disadvantage list, we would lose fine grained control over txins which
neuters the usefulness considerably. Also using version is also ugly
because there isn't a semantic association with what we are trying to
do, whereas, sequence is associated with transaction finality and is
thus the more appropriate and logical field to use.

What would you think of an approach like John Dillon's proposal to
explicitly give the economic majority of coin holders a vote for the max
blocksize? Miners could still vote BIP100 style for what max they were
willing to use, limited in turn by the vote of the economic majority.

I think in principle that would give all parties a clear voice in the
matter, which in turn makes whatever the result is more legitimit and
less controversial.

What fraction of coin holders do you suppose will vote? And, of those, what fraction have the technical knowledge to make an informed vote? It would be like polling Toyota truck owners to see whether the 2017 Tacoma should increase its engine's cylinder displacement by 10%. Ordinary users just aren't going to be able to vote meaningfully, and most won't respond to the poll at all.

Note that you can make the % of voters required adapt dyanmically to voter
interest. Also, your example is rather misleading, as car buyers *do*
make those kinds of decisions though various market mechanisms. Equally,
you can make the same criticism of democracy in general.

An interesting idea would be to design a voting mechanism such that only
users with access to validating nodes be able to vote - a fundemental
requirement for users to fully participate in Bitcoin's goverance.

Yes, car buyers do make those kinds of decisions through market mechanisms. An equivalent process for Bitcoin would be that the max block-size limit (and other fundamental economic parameters) would be determined via a process of forking off altcoins (such as Bitcoin XT will do) and allowing the market to decide which coin is most valuable. This is the "default" mechanism for change (because it's what naturally happens when there is a lack of internal consensus), but it's not the least painful mechanism.

My point still stands that ? just as in democracy in general ? the voters are really in no position to cast informed votes, nor should they be (cf. "rational ignorance" [1]). I do not oppose opening up the determination of the max block-size limit to a popular "check" via stakeholder vote ? actually, I think this is an important check on miners' power ? but I do argue that the vote is likely to have drastically little participation and very low-quality results.

I don't think this would work.

If the rule is that one user can only have one vote, how do you prevent
a user running multiple nodes?

Also, how do you verify that a node is indeed a fully validating node
with its own copy of the blockchain?

One should be clear that Bitcoin is by no possible measure a democracy.

The proposed vote is on what goes into a particular github repository.
The outcome is ultimately controlled by those with control of that
repository.

Bitcoin is an anarchy by design. People will use whatever they want.

The vote is not counted by nodes, but bitcoin amount, or probably
better, coin-days. It works like proof-of-stake. A mix of
proof-of-work and proof-of-stake is good.

To follow up on this, let's say that you want to be able to have up to 1
year relative lock-times. This choice is somewhat arbitrary and what I
would like some input on, but I'll come back to this point.

 * 1 bit is necessary to enable/disable relative lock-time.

 * 1 bit is necessary to indicate whether seconds vs blocks as the unit of
measurement.

 * 1 year of time with 1-second granularity requires 25 bits. However since
blocks occur at approximately 10 minute intervals on average, having a
relative lock-time significantly less than this interval doesn't make much
sense. A granularity of 256 seconds would be greater than the Nyquist
frequency and requires only 17 bits.

 * 1 year of blocks with 1-block granularity requires 16 bits.

So time-based relative lock time requires about 19 bits, and block-based
relative lock-time requires about 18 bits. That leaves 13 or 14 bits for
other uses.

Assuming a maximum of 1-year relative lock-times. But what is an
appropriate maximum to choose? The use cases I have considered have only
had lock times on the order of a few days to a month or so. However I would
feel uncomfortable going less than a year for a hard maximum, and am having
trouble thinking of any use case that would require more than a year of
lock-time. Can anyone else think of a use case that requires >1yr relative
lock-time?

TL;DR

The main advantage of relative locktime over absolute locktime is in
situations when it is not possible to determine when the clock should
start.   This inherently means lower delays.

As a workaround, you could chain transactions to extend the relative
locktime.

Transaction B has to be 360 days after transaction A and then transaction C
has to be 360 days after transaction B and C must be an input into the
final transaction.

The chain could be built up with multi-sig, like the refund transaction
system, so no one person can create an alternative chain.

As I understand Github is not to be used for the high-level discussion
of a draft BIP so I will post my thoughts here (is this specified
somewhere? Can we specify this in BIP-0001?).

-   I have some concerns about the structure and the wording of this
    proposal. I think both the structure and the internal wording can be
    slimmed down and simplified
    -   I also believe the "history lessons" should be trimmed out,
        mentioned at best
    -   There's separate BIP for at least one of the code forks
-   BIP-001 specifies that BIP proposals should not be given a BIP
    number until after they have been spelled checked and approved by an
    editor. Greg Maxwell: was this followed?
-   What kind of proposal is this? Informational, Process or Standards
    track?
    -   I believe it should be Standards Track. Include the proposed
        upgrade path as a patch into core as a module that hard forks
        can use in the future. This will also give us some space to work
        through some of the complexities of forks in a definite way.
    -   Alternatively maybe we can split up this BIP into a Standards
        track and a separate Informational BIP?

Yup.

To implement a vote where only users with access to a full node can
vote, you'd force part of the vote to be determined by a
non-miner-committed value calculatable by anyone with a full node. For
instance, a very simple toy example that would work is just XORing your
vote with SHA256(the entire blockchain)

Uh, that would totally not work.

I think my proposal of using CLTV to lock coins (votes) is better.
Failing a soft-fork to implement that in time, counting votes from the
UTXO set is also ok - the difference between that and CLTV is that it
is not as strong an evidence of commitment.

I don't get how it's very risky to have the Mike and Gavin redirect the
course of the bitcoin protocol but it's totally fine to consider complex
miner voting protocols as a hard fork option.

I believe that this community has not given due weight to the analysis
proposed by Peter__R on the existence of fee markets with  uncapped max
blocksizes. The critiques made toward his work were in no way definitive
and discussion just stopped. Is it the math that bothers people?

If his work stands the test of scrutiny, then a controlled raising of the
max blocksize in the interim to ease into the fee market dynamic described
is the best option. Possibly a stepwise BIP101 where the community
hardforks every two years until we all trust the fee market dynamics.

The main critique to uncapped max blocksizes which I've heard stems from
our incapacity to quantify the advantages that large miners have over
smaller ones. As I will show in an upcoming paper, these advantages do not
stem from the act of propagating large blocks but rather from the block
subsidies which allow miners to mine unnecessary large blocks irregardless
of the fees contained therein. One typical example is Peter Todd's
suggested attack whereby a miner creates a massive block filled with spam
transactions that pay himself solely to slow down the rest of the network
and gain an advantage. Putting aside the increased orphan risk arising from
the propagation of such a large block, this attack would never be viable if
it weren't for the existence of current block subsidies.

As such, exponential increases to the max blocksize make perfect sense
since the block reward decreases exponentially also. All arguments invoking
rates of technological advances (see Gavin's original posts) don't mean
anything. Rational miners will NOT be incentivized to mine gargantuan spam
filled blocks in the presence of a vanishing block reward.

I truly hope this matter gets the consideration it deserves. Particularly
with the upcoming scaling workshops.

Peter_R's analysis of fee markets in the absence of blocksize limits [1]
shows that the hashrate advantage of a large miner is a side-effect of
coinbase subsidization. As the block rewards get smaller, so will large
miner advantages. An easy way to think about this is as follows:

Currently, the main critique of larger blocksizes is that we'll connected
miners can cut out smaller miners by gratuitously filling up blocks with
self-paying transactions. This only works because block subsidies exist.
The moment block rewards become comparable to block TX fees, this exploit
ceases to be functional.

Basically, large miners will still be forced to move full blocks, but it
will go against their interest to fill them with spam since their main
source of income is the fees themselves. As a result, large miners (unlike
smaller ones) will lose the incentive to mine an un full block this evening
the playing field.

In this context, large blocksizes as proposed by BIP100-101 hope to
stimulate the increase of TX fees by augmenting the network's capacity. The
sooner block rewards become comparable to block fees, the sooner we will
get rid of mine centralization.

Maybe this helps undesrtanding the risks of a contentious/schism
hardfork: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR137
That section can be greatly improved though.

I have only skimmed the document, but I believe its conclusions (or
some of them) are right for the current propagation code.
The assumption may not stand if we move to something like IBLT though.
I believe that document also proves that it is
irrational/noncompetitive for miners to include ANY free transactions
at all (like they currently do).
But the analysis is about the effect of the maximum block size on
fees: there's more effects of that consensus rule.
The most important one being that it limits mining centralization (and
centralization in general).
This is true for at least 2 reasons: one is related to block
propagation and it is what is usually described.
At a bigger scale (even with crazy assumptions like constant time
infinite bandwidth, instant [superluminal] communication, zkSNARKS
block validity proofs ) minimum CPU costs will be something to limit
through the maximum block size consensus rule. There's a scale at
which the minimum CPU costs for a miner to be competitive may be so
high that some small miners without the resources to meet that minimum
will become unprofitable.
Admittedly we're not near that scale yet, but if something to take into account.

There are some simulations. See:
http://gavinandresen.ninja/are-bigger-blocks-better-for-bigger-miners

The goal of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6382 is to allow
people to do more realistic simulations (by using real full nodes).
That doesn't mean that more simplified simulations are worthless, but
I didn't want people to have to create their own testchain every time
they want to simulate a different size, like rusty had to do for:

http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=509

So the "incapacity to quantify the advantages that large miners have
over smaller ones" doesn't really exist.
It would be nice to have more data about this (more sizes, more
network topologies, etc) though.

Although smaller subsidies will remove some problems we currently
have, for example, SPV mining (there's no incentive to SPV mine
worthless empty blocks), I don't understand your claim that they will
also solve mining centralization problems related to block
propagation.

I really dislike basing the consensus rules on predictions about
future technology. For all I know, a terrible war could destroy half
of the global internet infrastructure in the next 5 years.
I prefer simpler increments like in bip102 (although I don't have the
data to know if 2MB is safe mining-centralization-wise at this point
[when mining centralization is pretty bad]).
Arguments against that kind of change are usually along the lines
"then we will have to repeat this same discussion in 1 or 2 years".
I believe that with the proper simulation tools being deployed and a
better general understanding of what the concerns are, the
conversation should be much simpler the next time.

Actually some simulations show they in fact have incentive to do just
that in some cases.
But more importantly, we shouldn't assume that all attackers are
rational miners. Maybe a potential attacker is a secret service or a
financial cartel attempting to destroy Bitcoin for whatever reason.

> I truly hope this matter gets the consideration it deserves. Particularly

I truly hope that the discussion can move forward into more productive
territories after the workshop, and I'm particularly interested in
Peter R's presentation, even if I haven't found the time to read his
paper yet. Even if fees are not the main reason why we want to have a
block size maximum, fees are certainly very relevant and anything that
he has mathematically proven in that regard will be useful to this
discussion.

OK, having implemented lightning test code against the initial proposal,
I can give the following anecdata:

- I screwed up inversion in my initial implementation.  Please kill it.

- 256 second granularity would be be fine in deployment, but a bit
  painful for testing (I currently use 60 seconds, and "sleep 61").  64
  would work better for me, and works roughly as minutes.

- 1 year should be sufficient as a max; my current handwave is <= 1 day
  per lightning hop, max 12 hops, though we have no deployment data.

- We should immediately deploy an IsStandard() rule which insists that
  nSequence is 0xFFFFFFFF or 0, so nobody screws themselves when we
  soft fork and they had random junk in there.

Aside: I'd also like to have nLockTime apply even if nSequence !=
0xFFFFFFFF (another mistake I made).  So I'd like an IsStandard() rule
to say it nLockTime be 0 if an nSequence != 0xFFFFFFFF.  Would that
screw anyone currently?

Thanks,
Rusty.

Message-ID: <CALoZ_LG7POrwNqtG9prvG_1T3+OcWNo9cKbiwHDu9xP85zqOEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am proposing to create a AML-KYC module to control the network and also
qualify use cases in OFAC compliant way.
Here is the attached doc.

Please provide your feedback and suggestions.

Title: A AML KYC enforcement mechanism to regulate OFAC(and similar others) from Mining

==Abstract==
The document gives specification for dealing with mining and transactions in sactioned countries to follow OFAC regulations in Bitcoin.

==Motivation==
For so long, miners in sanctioned countries or miners with illicit motives have been able to enmasse wealth by bitcoins which might or might not have been funding wrong doings of one or many non-mainstream social activities, like terrorism, human traffiking, drugs, rights abuse and many more of similar or advance nature. It is important for bitcoin community to realise the responsibility to put a control on such elements and at the same time uphold the values of bitcoin's decentralised and democratic money system. The same applies for transactions orgininating to or from such sanctioned countries.


==Specification==
To counter this problem, an bitcoin account can be centrally created in control and/or oversight of Bitcoin Foundation which should be allowed to do 0-sum transactions with a Memo Flag of BLOCK or ALLOW. And empty memo transaction has no impact. And this should be considered in consensus protocol for transaction confirmation, to BLOCK or ALLOW transactions in an account if the immediate previous transaction is BLOCK or ALLOW in that account, respectively.

==Rationale==
The Bitcoin Foundation will act as fair play party and enforcement body to control the misuse of vast financial powers which bitcoin has. The BLOCK and ALLOW is end action of a possible upstream review process for every account on the bitcoin network. The freedom of unchecked mining, poses a certain threat today and even bigger threats in future.
Even if someone is BLOCKed due to certain clerical mistakes, the process has ALLOW functionality. And if law enforcement comes with more substantial reasons of BLOCKing an account, the same be done multiple times.
We are a world of human beings with rationale, who have abilities to talk, listen and communicate. Therefore, a human to human touch can never be negated in however powerful computerisation.

==Backward compatibility==
The new consensus protocol could seem unfavourable to some due to many reasons. After listening to all parties, even if some nodes would opt to stay in old protocol, they won't be able to join the new protocol ever. This would be a hard fork and natural cleanup of bitcoin protocol from illicit miners and users.

==Implementation==
The implementation is in progress. The detail code will be shared soon.

==Acknowledgements==

I would prefer not to download an attachment.

Generally and without having the benefit of reading your document, AML and
or KYC requirements are treated on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.
You would probably need to factor obtaining a universal agreement between
all of the governments and regional enforcement bodies of the world on the
nature and scope of an acceptable set of policies before attempting to
attach rules to the protocol. Clearly, when one country unilaterally places
politicians of another country on banned lists and vice versa, for example,
would create some problems with implementation and automating checks
against banned lists produced by each country.

While you could apply a 'home rule' approach, you would be pushing
regulatory controls down to individuals transacting between each other
without having to go through any regulated intermediaries. This means you
have no way to enforce KYC or verify that the details are correct unless
you create a system of third party checkers in each country who would
enable transactions to proceed. To overcome all of this you would probably
need some identity verification system in place first and to add extra fees
into the network to pay for the maintenance of the system.

As has already been pointed out, the above would lead to individual coins
being tainted with previous ownership details creating the possibility for
blacklists rendering some coins worthless and creating the possibility of
these coins being passed on to unsuspecting users. All this goes against
the spirit of monetary systems, so you are back to regulating end points as
and when users come into contact with regulated entities.

Lastly, it might be worth knowing that criminal liability can be placed on
individuals responsible for implementing AML and KYC procedures and
policies that do not work or allow criminals to circumvent the systems of
controls.

Hello,

Please stop with the nonsense. Bitcoin is a decentralized payment
network. It operates globally, so neither jurisdiction can apply to it
and have effects. It is the sole responsibility of all the
users/businesses involved in Bitcoin to comply with their local
regulations while using Bitcoin. Trying to somehow standardize this
compliance at the backbone network level will be impossible in the
first place, and even if it was possible it would be a _huge_ mistake.

The word 'Bitcoin' already rings a bell in most places of the world
where there is a reasonable level of technology available. It is
powerful and we should continue the work to improve it. No law
enforcement authority or govt. branch is asking more than for
users/businesses to comply with the regulations that bind to them.
Someone in Belize for example does not have same compliance requests
with someone in Germany - which is why this is not even a subject to
be discussed on bicoin-dev mailing list. It is unique/custom for each
user/business, the requirements depending on their jurisdiction.

That sentence doesn't quite parse ("say it nLockTime"), so please
forgive me if I'm misunderstanding you. Are you saying that you want
IsStandard() to require a transaction have a locktime of 0 (no
confirmation delay) if any of its inputs use a non-final sequence?

If so, wouldn't that make locktime useless for delaying confirmation in
IsStandard() transactions because the consensus rules require at least
one input be non-final in order for locktime to have any effect?

Thanks,

-Dave

Thanks for the comments and feedback.
I have previously read those threads as suggested by some members.
In relation with transactions, I do agree with suggestions that they should
be left on their own, and assumed that people would work in the  best
interest of themselves and society. Everything is debatable, but let's
agree with it.
But for miners, I can think of no other option to stop those who are
hashing and winning blocks+transaction fees and not in safe country
list(directly or indirectly).
Some have asked for proofs, but that is tough to substantiate. I have
hints, honestly.

Would you sit idle if Haqqani network is funded by bitcoin mining?

We have created a billion dollar market by bitcoin and ,sadly, for everyone
without borders. Sick, I am saying this, but freedom is more of
responsibility than celebrations of open hugs. And those who don't care
about it are threat for you and us, equally.

Folks, suggest something, scrap my idea, but let's build something to save
this ecosystem, otherwise it is impossible to realise this dream of
decentralized currency. Other coins and protocols are there who may
implement something, and egoists always meet the ashes.

Criticize with open mind.

Best,
Prabhat Kumar Singh

This is not needed because BIP68 is not active for version 1 tx. No

Do you mean "have nLockTime apply even if nSequence = 0xFFFFFFFF"? This 
is a softfork. Should we do this together with BIP65, BIP68 and BIP112?

Have you talked with anybody at the Bitcoin Foundation about this proposal?

As Chief Scientist of the Foundation, I am strongly opposed to any proposal
that puts the Foundation in a position of centralized authority, so this is
unacceptable: "The Bitcoin Foundation will act as fair play party and
enforcement body to control the misuse of vast financial powers which
bitcoin has."

The idea that a central organization can be trusted to keep secrets secure
is just fundamentally wrong. In the very recent past we have seen
government organizations fail in that task (the NSA, the OPM) and we see
commercial organizations that SHOULD be highly motivated to do a good job
also fail (e.g. the Ashley Madison leak).

Even if it were technically possible, I would be opposed because
decentralization is a bedrock principle of Bitcoin.

This is a development list; organizations like https://coincenter.org/ work
on high-level policy issues.

Last I heard, competent law enforcement organizations said they were
perfectly capable of tracking down criminals using Bitcoin using
traditional investigative techniques (like infiltrating criminal
organizations or setting up honeypots). Given how many "dark markets" have
either disappeared or been taken down, it seems they are correct.

I have been reading the pdf and one thing I can't figure out is what you
mean by "most common floor". Is that the smallest block size that has a
vote or the block size with the most votes or something else?

Proposal 1 does not deal with Tx fee. Proposal 2 does. According to
proposal 2, miners wont be able to increase or decrease Max Block Size only
by manipulating Tx fee. They have to manipulate...
i. Tx fee of ~4000 blocks.
ii. Block size of ~4000 blocks.

I never proposed *next block collects Tx fee from previous block*. Not sure
what you mean here!

Guys,
 I strongly think the original prabhat e-mail is a parody.

And I find very funny that important people have responded.

But maybe I'm wrong!

AML-KYC is mostly something that sits on top of the Bitcoin protocol. 
Take Coinase, inc. as an example.  They check bank accounts before they 
open your account and they link your Bitcoin address to your account in 
their database.  Then they ask for an explanation of why you are using 
the account.  Then they track your coins to a certain extent once you 
actually buy Bitcoins.  None of these activities are directly involving 
the protocol or would require changes to the Bitcoin system.

What you can do is develop standards for using Bitcoin and entities that 
need to follow AML-KYC can choose to follow those standards if they want 
when they conduct business using Bitcoin.  You can add a small amount of 
extraneous data to transactions that could show you followed some 
AML-KYC procedure.  If you did that you could have a "white list" of 
complaint transactions rather than a "black list" of non-compliant 
transactions as you seem to be proposing.  I am not sure how you would 
actually do something like that or how it would work but it is an 
interesting concept (not necessarily good, but interesting).

So you mean that,

   1. Govt agencies already know about everything and anything this subject
   is about, but passively.
   2. Due to passive nature, the actions are post incident and not pre. So
   there is a risk of many ticking time-bombs which some JB (Jack Bauer or
   James Bond or Jai Singh Rathore) would diffuse. Sorry for being dramatic,
   the purpose is to make the point, and nothing else.
   3. The subjected proposal doesn't breach the decentralisation, but just
   not like swiss democracy.

I am not a legal expert, but know this much that there are 2 kinds of
crimes, one against liberty and other against life. Most of online privacy
advocacy is for liberty. But money is attached to life and not liberty. So
this has to change. It means life for many and many depend on it.

And the appeal is, Let us get active.

PS: I do not own much of bitcoins to be an advocate, but many others do and
any mayhem would affect me somehow, even if in farthest of world.

Best,

Prabhat Kumar Singh

>>>But money is attached to life and not liberty

I can't truly express in this email exactly how much I personally disagree
with that statement/belief because I don't think the dev mailing list is
the appropriate forum for such philosophical discussions.

I will say this, though: I think you've missed much of the point of Bitcoin
-- which "monetary or economic liberty" might perfectly describe -- and, I
sincerely hope that proposals such as yours never gain ANY traction in this
community.

As far as I'm concerned, your ideas are the antithesis of this entire
experiment.

I'd be glad to have this discussion over a beer and hookah any time, but I
won't take up any more space or time with it here.

Oliver

PS: sorry everyone! I just couldn't let this one go without comment... I'll
go back to my usual lurking and learning now. :)

Prabhat,

You write about OFAC, KYC, and AML.
The *Office of Foreign Assets Control* (*OFAC*) is a financial intelligence
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_intelligence> and enforcement
agency of the U.S. government charged with planning and execution of
economic and trade sanctions
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions> in support of U.S. national
security
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_of_the_United_States>
and foreign
policy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States>
objectives.
KYC means "Know Your Customer" which is something every intelligent
businessman does when his deals are significant.  Support for "KYC" is
built into reality and needs no qualification, compliance, or control.
AML means "Anti-Money-Laundering" which smacks of overreach.  Laundering
money serves to hide behaviors that authorities dislike, many of which are
actually helping the world.  Neomoney says it best
<http://neomoney.net/?p=426>: "Indeed, money laundering describes a wide
range of activities that are undertaken by innocent participants in the
economy. Authorities? growing expectation of a right to violate our privacy
to enforce their laws, and an expectation that we do nothing to protect
ourselves from that violation of privacy, lie at the heart of money
laundering propaganda."

So your work comes across as that of someone who has been duped into doing
the bidding of the largest and most successful criminal organization on
Earth.  I do not accuse you of being deceived because no one can be blamed
for the damage done to them by such a powerful parasite.  I wish only to
open your eyes, or, at least what worked for me, your ears

> 23:58 < petertodd> It's still dodgy though... I was thinking if nLockTime-by-time inclusion was based on the previous block timestamp it'd be ok, but that still leaves large miners with incentives to screw with the 2hr window, never mind how it can reduce competition if there exists clock skew in the mining nodes.

(their orphan rate is less)

> 00:27 < petertodd> gmaxwell: Worst case is easy - your block is orphaned.
> 00:28 < petertodd> gmaxwell: See the issue is that once I find a block, the other side needs to find two blocks to beat me. As time goes on more of the other sides hashing power will accept my from the future block as valid, so then you get the next level where the remainder needs three blocks and so on.
> 00:28 < petertodd> gmaxwell: Pretty sure it can't be done as a closed-form equation.

I have changed BIPS 112 and 113 to reflect this amended deployment
strategy. I'm beginning to think the issues created by Bitcoin XT are
so serious it probably deserves converting OPs text into an
informational BIP.

I thought we had decided that the masking thing doesn't work as
intended?

To recap, XT nodes are producing blocks with nVersion=0b001...111

You're suggesting that we apply a mask of ~0b001...111 then trigger the
soft-fork on nVersion >= 0b0...100 == 4, with miners producing blocks with
nVersion=0b0...1000

That will work, but it still uses up a version bit. The reason why is
blocks with nVersion=0b001...000 - the intended deployment of the
nVersion bits proposal - will be rejected by the nVersion >= 4 rule,
hard-forking them off the network. In short, we have in fact "burnt" a
version bit unnecessarily.

If you're going to accept hard-forking some people off the network, why
not just go with my stateless nVersion bits w/ time-expiration proposal
instead? The only case where it leads to a hard-fork is if a soft-fork
has been rejected by the time the upgrade deadline is reached. It's easy
to set this multiple years into the future, so I think in practice it
won't be a major issue for non-controversial soft-forks.

Equally, spending the time to implement the original stateful nVersion
bits proposal is possible as well, though higher risk due to the extra
complexity of tracking soft-fork state.

So I've created 2 new repositories with changed rules regarding
sequencenumbers:

https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/tree/sequencenumbers2

This repository inverts (un-inverts?) the sequence number. nSequence=1
means 1 block relative lock-height. nSequence=LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD means 1
second relative lock-height. nSequence>=0x80000000 (most significant bit
set) is not interpreted as a relative lock-time.

https://github.com/maaku/bitcoin/tree/sequencenumbers3

This repository not only inverts the sequence number, but also interprets
it as a fixed-point number. This allows up to 5 year relative lock times
using blocks as units, and saves 12 low-order bits for future use. Or, up
to about 2 year relative lock times using seconds as units, and saves 4
bits for future use without second-level granularity. More bits could be
recovered from time-based locktimes by choosing a higher granularity (a
soft-fork change if done correctly).

You could study bitcoin some more and understand what it is instead of
proposing to "implement AML-KYC in bitcoin" which shows vast ignorance
about it.

That's probably what you should do.

I've done some work in this area. see http://coinvalidation.com/ it's
currently shelved due to lack of legal and regulatory framework.

1. this should not be directly implemented on the protocol level. I believe
its Jeff Garzik who once said "stolen bitcoins is a legal problem, not a
technical one." Legal problems are not technical problems.

2. it is the responsibility of company and individuals to answer questions.
example, stolen bitcoins gets send to address X, and address X is a payment
address of company Y. it is company Y's responsibility to answer to
corresponding agencies responsible. What actions comes out of that is yet
to be determent.

other examples such as, you are using a wallet app, and sending bitcoin
payments to a known malicious address. ( e.g. crypto-locker or other
malware address that replaces the output address.), does the wallet app
warn its users?

Again, while these are not technical problems, they will need answers
eventually. I'll be happy to discuss further off this mailing list as it is
off-topic.

Mode could be ruled out immediately. Just consider this: 34% 8MB, 33% 
1.5MB, 33% 1.2MB

I personally believe the median is the most natural and logical choice. 
51% of miners can always force the 49% to follow the simple majority 
choice through a 51% attack. Using median will eliminate the incentive 
to 51% attack due to this reason. The incentive to 51% attack will exist 
when you use any value other than 50-percentile. The further it is from 
50, the bigger the incentive.

Having said that, I don't think it is an absolutely bad idea to use a 
value other than 50-percentile. The exact value is debatable.

However, if you use something other than median, you should make it 
symmetrical. For example, the block size will increase if the 
20-percentile is bigger than the current limit, and the block size will 
decrease if the 80-percentile is smaller than the current limit.

There has been discussion of using the genesis block hash to identify
chains in BIP 21 (bitcoin:// URI scheme). However, this does not allow
identification between blockchain forks building upon the same genesis
block. While many see this as undesirable, I think it is inevitable that
this will eventually happen at some point, and think it is best to build
systems redundantly.

I propose identifying blockchains for BIP 21 and any other relevant needs
through:

1) the genesis block hash for a new chain, or
2) a hash of the genesis block hash,  concatenated with block hash(es) of
fork point(s) for a fork chain

This would support forks, forks of forks, forks of forks of forks, etc
while preserving a fixed length chain identifier.

If a user wants to specify "whatever chain is the longest with PoW", they
would use (1). In times where multiple chains are coexisting and being
actively mined, a user can use (2) to specifically identify a chain.

Thoughts?

I have an ugly solution to this problem, with minimal change to the 
current softfork logic, and still allows all features described in 
sipa's Version bits BIP

1. xVersion = nVersion AND 0b10000000000000000000000000011000
2. miners supporting BIP65 will set xVersion = 8 or greater
3. If 750 of the last 1000 blocks are xVersion >= 8, reject invalid 
xVersion 8 (or greater) blocks
4. If 950 of the last 1000 blocks are xVersion >= 8, reject all blocks 
with xVersion < 8

So the logic is exactly the same as BIP66, with the AND masking in step 
1. After the BIP65 softfork is implied, xVersion may take only one of 
the following values: 8, 16, 24

This is basically moving the "high bits" in sipa's proposal to the 
middle of the nVersion field. After the BIP65 softfork, this will still 
leave 29 available bits for parallel soft forks, just in different 
position.

This is ugly, but I believe this is the easiest solution

Why would you use a hash of hashes? Wouldn't it be simpler and just as effective to use either:

1) the genesis block hash, or
2) the block hash of the first block in a fork?

Every block hash in a chain implicitly subsumes the genesis block hash of that chain, so there's no need to incorporate the genesis block hash again.

<pre>
  BIP: XX
  Title: Consensus based block size retargeting algorithm
  Author: BtcDrak <btcdrak at gmail.com>
  Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2015-08-21
</pre>

==Abstract==

A method of altering the maximum allowed block size of the Bitcoin protocol
using a consensus based approach.

==Motivation==

There is a belief that Bitcoin cannot easily respond to raising the
blocksize limit if popularity was to suddenly increase due to a mass adoption
curve, because co-ordinating a hard fork takes considerable time, and being
unable to respond in a timely manner would irreparably harm the credibility of
bitcoin.

Additionally, predetermined block size increases are problematic because they
attempt to predict the future, and if too large could have unintended
consequences like damaging the possibility for a fee market to develop
as block subsidy decreases substantially over the next 9 years; introducing
or exacerbating mining attack vectors; or somehow affect the network in unknown
or unpredicted ways. Since fixed changes are hard to deploy, the damage could be
extensive.

Dynamic block size adjustments also suffer from the potential to be gamed by the
larger hash power.

Free voting as suggested by BIP100 allows miners to sell their votes out of band
at no risk, and enable the sponsor the ability to manipulate the blocksize.
It also provides a cost free method or the larger pools to vote in ways to
manipulate the blocksize such to disadvantage or attack smaller pools.


==Rationale==

By introducing a cost to increase the block size ensures the mining community
will collude to increase it only when there is a clear necessity, and reduce it
when it is unnecessary. Larger miners cannot force their wishes so easily
because not only will they have to pay extra a difficulty target, then can be
downvoted at no cost by the objecting hash power.

Using difficulty as a penalty is better than a fixed cost in bitcoins because it
is less predictable.


==Specification==

The initial block size limit shall be 1MB.

Each time a miner creates a block, they may vote to increase or decrease the
blocksize by a maximum of 10% of the current block size limit. These votes will
be used to recalculate the new block size limit every 2016 blocks.

Votes are cast using the block's coinbase field.

The first 4 bytes of the coinbase field shall be repurposed for voting as an
unsigned long integer which will be the block size in bytes.

If a miner votes for an increase, the block hash must meet a difficulty target
which is proportionally larger than the standard difficulty target based on the
percentage increase they voted for.

Votes proposing decreasing the block size limit do not need to meet a higher
difficulty target.

Miners can vote for no change by voting for the current block size.

For blocks to be valid the blockhash must meet the required difficulty target
for the vote otherwise the block is invalid and will be rejected.

Every 2016 blocks, the block size limit will be recalculated by the median of
all votes in the last 2016 blocks. This will redefine the block size limit for
the next 2016 blocks.

Blocks that are larger than the calculated base block size limit are invalid and
will be rejected.

The base block size limit may not reduce below 1MB.


==Acknowledgements==

This proposal is based on ideas and concepts derived from the writings of
Meni Rosenfeld and Gregory Maxwell.

Yes, this seems like the best solution in the schism hardfork case.
What both sides of a schism hardfork would want is to avoid hurting
bystander users who can't tell the difference between the old and the
new currency/chain.

I should extend BIP99's section on schism hardforks.

This is the best proposal I've seen yet. Allow me to summarize:

? It addresses the problem, in Jeff Garzik's BIP 100, of miners selling their block-size votes.
? It addresses the problem, in Gavin Andresen's BIP 101, of blindly trying to predict future market needs versus future technological capacities.
? It avoids a large step discontinuity in the block-size limit by starting with a 1-MB limit.
? It throttles changes to ?10% every 2016 blocks.
? It imposes a tangible cost (higher difficulty) on miners who vote to raise the block-size limit.
? It avoids incentivizing miners to vote to lower the block-size limit.

However, this proposal currently fails to answer a very important question:

? What is the mechanism for activation of the new consensus rule? It is when a certain percentage of the blocks mined in a 2016-block retargeting period contain valid block-size votes?

With this proposal, how much would it cost a miner to include an 'extra' 500-byte transaction if the average block size is 900K and it costs the miner 20BTC in electricity/capital/etc to mine a block?

If my understanding of the proposal is correct, it is:

500/900000 * 20 = 0.11111 BTC

... Or $2.50 at today's exchange rate.

That seems excessive.

When discussing this with Matt Whitlock earlier we basically concluded the
block size will never increase under this proposal do to a collective
action problem. If a miner votes for an increase and nobody else does, the
blocksize will not increase yet he will still have to pay the difficulty
penalty.

It may be in everyone's collective interest to raise the block size but not
their individual interest.

I chose not to address hard fork methodology at this stage because I
wanted to focus on the main algorithm. There are a number of options
open to us for deployment including a simple fixed activation (which I
think is feasible because there is a a lot of awareness and the
industry shows they are willing to rally around a single proposal). If
there are any strong preferences, I can add a deployment section
although I think it's less interesting until we forge a clear way

It is in their individual interests when the larger block that is allowed
for them grants them more fees.

Typo, 0.01111

I am not sure how it is relevant to this proposal because miners are
not paying to include an extra transaction. The BIP details how miners
can vote for a larger block size limit during a window of 2016 blocks.
The block size limit does not increase during this phase. The block
size limit is adjusted at the end of the sample window and the new
size is valid until the next retargetting.

If this wasn't clear, please let me know if I need to clarify any
specifics in the wording of the proposal.

But that's not what this proposal does. They have to pay the difficulty penalty merely for a *chance* at later being able to mine larger blocks.

Maybe this could be fixed by allowing miners to produce a larger-than-limit block *immediately* by paying a difficulty penalty. Then we can simply take the 80th-percentile block size in each 2016-block period as the nominal block-size limit in the next period.

And pay a difficulty penalty and lose full blocks because of it? Even if
fees are somehow high enough to compensate for the lost reward, it still
requires miners to collectively decide to raise the block size for it to
make sense individually. An individual vote will not raise the limit, but
it will cost the miner money.

Can we please not discuss an ideal deployment mechanism in 4+
different proposals and discuss the same deployment mechanism (for all
proposals) in BIP99's thread instead?

It is clear from recent events that miners are willing to collaborate
together for the greater good of their industry. Miners have also
publicly shown support for raising the blocksize collaboratively.

Obviously, as transaction volume grows they want to collect as many
transaction fees as possible so if there isnt enough space in blocks,
they're going to vote for increases because it's in their collective
financial interests. The proposal specifically encourages
collaboration and hinders antisocial behaviour, and it specifically
encourages the blocksize to be raised according to demand without
neutering the fee market.

I realize now that this is not what Greg Maxwell proposed (aka
flexcap): this is just miner's voting on block size but paying with
higher difficulty when they vote for bigger blocks.
As I said several times in other places, miners should not decide on
the consensus rule to limit mining centralization.
People keep talking about miners voting on the block size or
"softforking the size down if we went too far". But what if the
hashing majority is perfectly fine with the mining centralization at
that point in time?
Then a softfork won't be useful and we're talking about an "anti-miner
fork" (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR158
and  https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR175
).

I believe miner's voting on the rule to limit mining centralization is
a terrible idea.
It sounds as bad as letting pharma companies write the regulations on
new drugs safety, letting big food chains deciding on minimum food
controls or car manufacturers deciding on indirect taxes for fuel.
That's why I dislike both this proposal and BIP100.

Ah, then my mistake. It seemed so similar to an idea that was proposed
before on this mailing list:

http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-May/008033.html

that my mind just filled in the gaps. I concur -- having miners -- or any
group -- vote on block size is not an intrinsically good thing. The the
original proposal due to Greg Maxwell et al was not a mechanism for
"voting" but rather a feedback control that made the maximum block size
that which generated the most fees.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Variable Block Size Proposal
Message-ID: <55E145EF.3060801@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hey Bitcoiners!

While I am an avid Bitcoin supporter, long-term user, and have done
development work on tools and platforms surrounding Bitcoin, I have
been very busy these past few weeks and haven't had a chance to fully
(or closely) monitor the Block Size debate.

I'm familiar with the basics, and have read abstracts about the
front-running proposals (BIP 100, 101, and 102). Though I've honestly
not read those in depth either. With that said, I was driving
the other day and thought of a potential idea. I'll be clear, this is
just an idea, and I haven't fully fleshed it out. But I thought I'd
throw it out there and see what people thought.

My Goal:

Provide a variable block size that provides for sustainable, long-term
growth, and balances the block propagation, while also being mindful
of potential spam attacks.

The Proposal:

Every 2016 blocks (approximately every two weeks, at the same time the
difficulty is adjusted), the new block size parameters are calculated.

The calculation determines the average (mean) size of the past 2016
blocks. This "average" size is then doubled (200%) and used as the
maximum block size for the subsequent 2016 blocks. At any point, if
the new maximum size is calculated to be below 1MB, 1MB is used
instead (which prevents regression from our current state).

Introduce a block minimum, the minimum will be 25% of the current
maximum, calculated at the same time (that is, every 2016 blocks, at
the same time the maximum is calculated). All blocks must be at least
this size in order to be valid, for blocks that do not have enough
transactions to meet the 25%, padding will be used. This devalues the
incentive to mine empty blocks in either an attempt to deflate the
block size, or to obtain a propagation advantage. Miners will be
incentivized to include transactions, as the block must meet the
minimum. This should ensure that even miners wishing to always mine
the minimum are still confirming Bitcoin transactions.

At the block in which this is introduced the maximum would stay at 1MB
for the subsequent 2016 blocks. With the minimum being enforced of 256KB
.

Example:

    * Average Block Size for the last 2016 blocks: 724KB
    * New Maximum: 1448KB
    * New Minimum: 362KB

Example: (Regression Prevention)

    * Average Block Size for the last 2016 blocks: 250KB
    * New Maximum: 1MB
    * New Minimum: 256KB

The Future:

I believe that the 1MB regression prevention might need to be changed
in the future, to prevent a large mining population from continually
deflating the block size (and keeping us at the 1MB limit).

For this, the hard limit could be changed in the future manually,
through a process similar to the current one, though hopefully with
far less urgency and hysteria.

Another option is to add an additional calculation, preventing the new
maximum from being lower than 75% of the current maximum. This would
substantially slow down a block-size deflation attack.

 Example of Block-Size Deflation Attack Prevention:

 * Average Block Size for the last 2016 blocks:  4MB
 * New Maximum:  8MB
 * New Minimum:  2MB

 * Average Block Size for the last 2016 blocks:  2MB
 * New Maximum:  6MB  (2 * 200% = 4, 4< 75% of 8, So use 8 * .75 = 6)
 * New Minimum:  1.5MB

This would provide a maximum growth of 200% per recalculation, but a
maximum shrinkage of 75%.

Request For Comments:

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Why wouldn't this work? What portion
is flawed? Will the miners support such a proposal? Would this even
solve the block size issue?

I will note that I don't find the 100% and 25% to be hard and fast in
my idea. Those we're just the values that initially jumped out at me.
I could easily see the minimum being anything below 50% (above 50% and
the network can never adjust to smaller block sizes). I could also see
the maximum being anything over 100%.  Lastly, if a inflation attack
is a valid concern, a hard upper limit could be set (or the historical
32MB limit could remain).

I think the great part about this variable approach is that the
network can adjust to address spikes in volume and readjust once those
spikes dissipate.

When have miners shown a willingness to make sacrifices for miners as a
whole when they've been in a "public good"[1] situation? Miners
collaborating to release statements to the public about which BIPs they
support is very different from miners incurring costs only to themselves in
order to help the entire group. They might do so, but it isn't clear.

I agree with Jorge and Mark that allowing miners to vote on the block size
is not ideal. Miners interests are somewhat aligned with those of the
broader community, but not perfectly aligned. The block size level that
maximizes miner revenue is not necessarily desirable overall. More miner
revenue is only good if the marginal extra security that it buys is worth
the extra cost. In addition to the cost of higher user fees, there's
another hidden cost. In Bitcoin's early stages trying to maximize revenue
too soon can slow growth and result in less revenue when it's more needed
(when block rewards are much lower).

We need some game theory experts to analyse this but I see there are 3 
major problems:

1. Tragedy of the commons: Some miners have to scarify their income to 
increase the block size, and all miners will share the beneficial 
outcome of the increase. All miners would like to be free riders.

2. Promote the formation of mining cartel: miners have to make sure that 
their vote for increase is supported by at least 50% of miners, or they 
will lose income for nothing. A miner also needs to make sure that he is 
not voting "excessively" (in terms of size and vote count), as the 
excessive part will never be counted due to the use of median. So 
basically you will either have exactly 1009 miners voting for the same 
size increase in a cycle, or have no vote for increase at all. That will 
require a lot of offline negotiations. Such cartel may work ONLY if 
mining is highly centralized, and miners trust each other. Also, there 
is no mechanism to punish those who betray the cartel.

3. Imbalance of power: it is costly to increase the size, while totally 
free to decrease the size

Mark and Jorge,

I am very glad you have brought up this particular objection because
it's something I thought about but was unclear if it was an opinion
that would be shared by others. I chose to omit it from the proposal
to see if it would come up during peer review.

I feel that giving miners a blank cheque to increase blocksize, by any
means, goes against a key design of bitcoin's security model. Full
nodes keep miners honest by ensuring by validating their blocks. Under
any voting-only scheme there is no way for full nodes to keep miners
in cheque because miner have free reign to increase the blocksize.

This problem can be solved by introducing a hard cap on blocksize. By
introducing an upper limit miners now have the freedom to increase
blocksize but only within defined parameters.  Remember my proposal
allows blocksize to increase and decrease in such a way that miners
must collectively agree if they want the size to increase.

I believe the idea of a hard upper limit has become rather politicised
but is essential to the security model of bitcoin.

With respect to the flexicap idea where miners can create a larger
block by paying extra difficulty, I believe that proposal has a
critical flaw because, as Gavin pointed out, it makes it very
expensive (and risky) to include a few extra transactions. I believe
it suffers from tragedy of the commons because there is no incentive
for the mining community to reach consensus. Each and every block is
going to be a gamble, "should we include a few extra transactions at
the risk of losing the block?". Under my proposal miners can
collectively agree to change the blocksize. Let's say they want a 10%
increase, they can collude together to make that increase and once
reached, it remains until they want to change it again. Yet, the upper
hard limit keeps the ultimate control of the maximum block size
squarely in the hands of full nodes.

Whilst the exact number may be up for discussion, I would propose an
initial upper limit of 8MB, so under my proposal the blocksize would
be flexible between 1MB and 8MB.

An alternative methodology to voting in the coinbase would be to
change the vote to be the blocksize itself

1. miners pay extra difficulty to create a larger block.
2. every 2016 blocks the average or median of the last 2016 blocks is
calculated and becomes the new maximum blocksize limit.

This would retain incentive to collude to increase blocksize, as well
as the property of costing to increase while being free to propose
decrease.

It would still require an upper blocksize limit in order for full
nodes to retain control. Without an upper limit, any proposal is going
to break the security model as full nodes give up some oversight
control over miners.

Another way of looking at these ideas is we're raising blocksize hard
limit (to 8MB or whatever is decided), but making a soft of "softer"
or inner limit part of consensus. Such a concept is not really
departing from the current idea of a soft limit except to make it
consensus enforced. Obviously it's not identical, but I think you can
see the similarities.

Does that make sense?

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] RFC - BIP: URI scheme for Blockchain exploration
Message-ID: <CAE0pACLMcMzHkA=vEx+fiEmq7FA1bXDc4t_hQ+955=r=62V5=g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
My first post here, hope I'm following the right conventions.
I had this humble idea for a while, so I thought to go ahead and propose
it.

BIP: XX
Title: URI scheme for Blockchain exploration
Author: Marco Pontello
Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Created: 29 August 2015

Abstract
========
This BIP propose a simple URI scheme for looking up blocks, transactions,
addresses on a Blockchain explorer.

Motivation
==========
The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to handle all the
requests for details about blocks, transactions, etc. with their preferred
tool (being that a web service or a local application).

Currently a Bitcoin client usually point to an arbitrary blockchain
explorer when the user look for the details of a transaction (es. Bitcoin
Wallet use BitEasy, Mycelium or Electrum use Blockchain.info, etc.).
Other times resorting to cut&paste is needed.
The same happens with posts and messages that reference some particular
txs or blocks, if they provide links at all.

Specification
=============
The URI follow this simple form:

blockchain: <hash/string>

Examples:

blockchain:00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198
blockchain:001949
blockchain:3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a

Rationale
=========
I thought about using some more complex scheme, or adding qualifiers to
distinguish blocks from txs, but in the end I think that keeping it simple
should be practical enough. Blockchain explorers can apply the same
disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search
box.

>From the point of view of a wallet developer (or other tool that need to
show any kind of Blockchain references), using this scheme mean that he
can simply make it a blockchain: link and be done with it, without having
to worry about any specific Blockchain explorer or provide a means for the
user to select one.

Blockchain explorers in turn will simply offer to handle the blockchain:
URI, the first time the user visit their website, or launch/install the
application, or even set themselves if there isn't already one.

Users get the convenience of using always their preferred explorer, which
can be especially handy on mobile devices, where juggling with cut&paste
is far from ideal.

I don't think you'll find much support for introducing a mandatory minimum
block size. It's quite wasteful to "pad" blocks with transactions that the
miner is just sending back to themself. If you want to solve the block
propagation issue, I'd recommend instead working on O(1) block propagation.

The Bitcoin Relay Network already allows miners to relay blocks much
faster: http://bitcoinrelaynetwork.org/

The next step would be getting O(1) block propagation into the Bitcoin
protocol. Check out Gavin's proposal:

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] RFC - BIP: URI scheme for Blockchain exploration
In-Reply-To: <CAE0pACLMcMzHkA=vEx+fiEmq7FA1bXDc4t_hQ+955=r=62V5=g@mail.gmail.com>

I like the idea of having a standard for this, that all explorers (and even core, eventually) would understand.

I would recommend 2 changes though. First, using a real URI scheme, blockchain:// so that we can just use normal URL parsing libraries. The bitcoin: thing leads to additional code to mutate it into a proper URI before passing it to URL parsing. And I think it would be fine to include the type looking up. For example:

blockchain://blockhash/00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198
blockchain://txid/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a
blockchain://block/189000
blockchain://address/1RicMooMWxqKczuRCa5D2dnJaUEn9ZJyn

I think this would help the URI be more human understandable as well as give the explorers the ability to optimize a bit what they are looking for when hitting various databases.

A possible future path could also include blockchain://tx/123000/4 for block height, tx index... Another possibility could be blockchain://version which would return a list of supported paths, version of the BIP supported, etc.

The BIP should also specify little endian searching. I'm not sure, but would it also make sense for this BIP to include what the return results should look like? Maybe another, related BIP.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] On the Nature of Miner Advantages in Uncapped Block
	Size Fee Markets
Message-ID: <CAEgR2PHggX-8r+FZm=pod9KQv3E3=8wo-9nOB02-YDmy5NGsZQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to submit this paper to the dev-list which analyzes how miner
advantages scale with network and mempool properties in a scenario of
uncapped block sizes. The work proceeds, in a sense, from where Peter R's
work left off correcting a mistake and addressing the critiques made by the
community to his work.

The main result of the work is a detailed analysis of mining advantages
(defined as the added profit per unit of hash) as a function of miner
hashrate. In it, I show how large block subsidies (or better, low mempool
fees-to-subsidy ratios) incentivize the pooling of large hashrates due to
the steady increasing of marginal profits as hashrates grow.

The paper also shows that part of the large advantage the large miners have
today is due to there being a barrier to entry into a high-efficiency
mining class which has access to expected profits an order of magnitude
larger than everyone else. As block subsidies decrease, this
high-efficiency class is expected to vanish leading to a marginal profit
structure which decreases as a function of hashrate.

This work has vacuumed my entire life for the past two weeks leading me to
lag behind on a lot of work. I apologize for typos which I may not have
seen. I stand by for any comments the community may have and look forward
to reigniting consideration of a block size scaling proposal (BIP101)
which, due to the XT fork drama, I believe has been placed hastily and
undeservedly on the chopping block.

bitcoin:12345 *is* a "real" URI. It's just not an absolute, hierarchical URI (a.k.a. a URL); rather, it's an opaque URI.

And your suggestion is actually in violation of the URI spec, since "blockhash", "txid", "block", and "address" are not host names.

More correct would be:

blockchain:?blockhash=00000000000000001003e880d500968d51157f210c632e08a652af3576600198

blockchain:?block=189000
blockchain:?address=1RicMooMWxqKczuRCa5D2dnJaUEn9ZJyn

You should read the URI syntax RFC: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986

I don't like relying on exponential growth (that's why I don't like neither
Gavin's 101 nor Pieter's 103).

But I don't think it's too late to turn bip101 into just another proposal
for an uncontroversial hardfork (changing the 75% to 95% would be the first
step) and xt into just another software fork.

My favorite one so far is bip102 (even though I still consider "2mb now"
arbitrary and I'm worried about making mining centralization even worse
than it is now), but if it was framed as a schism hardfork like bip101 I
would also warn about the dangers of a schism hardfork for it.

I'll read it to try to understand your claims. Are you presentung this in
the scaling workshop?

In principle I am sympathetic to dynamic block size proposals...but in
practice it seems we're barking up the wrong tree. Without mechanisms for
incentivizing validators...and checks and balances between the interests of
regular users (who want to reduce fees and confirmation time), miners (who
want to balance hashing and propagation time costs with revenue), and
validator nodes (who currrently lack any direct incentives), I think we're
talking about significant protocol complications with potential benefits
that are hard to model at best.

Good thinking! It might make sense to look at the existing de-facto
standard (e.g. blockexplorer.com, blockchain.info):

/tx/ for transactions
/block/ for blocks, supports both hash or height
/address/ for address

That's fine too.  Obviously the variable maximum would work just fine
without a minimum.  In fact, with the O(1) propagation proposal, a
minimum number of transactions could be enforced, think - a percentage
of the current mempool.  That's actually far more meaningful to both
miners and consumers.

testnet for example?

blockchain://mainnet/txid/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a

or

blockchain://txid/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a

That's still not right, since "mainnet" and "testnet" are not host names.

I am quite skeptical about any pay-to-increase proposal because it is 
difficult to predict the game dynamics and determine the right amount of 
penalty. But anyway, here is my response to your revised proposal:

1. I agree with you that there should be a cap in the rate of change, 
and also the maximum possible size. This is already part of BIP100

2. Requiring a higher difficulty is bad for everyone:
  a) it increases the variance of the miner;
  b) average confirmation time for all tx are increased. It may even 
cause a feedback: many tx in mempool -> increase block size -> wait 
longer for confirmation -> more tx in mempool;
  c) difficulty of the next round will be decreased, leading to a greater 
fluctuation in confirmation time.

Instead, you should require miners to burn their coinbase reward. This 
is effectively same as higher difficulty but is good for everyone: a) 
mining variance and confirmation time unchanged; b) all bitcoin holders 
become relatively richer

If you don't want to burn any bitcoin, you may require the miner the 
send to penalty to <840000 + current height> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, 
which will subsidize the mining when the block reward drops below 1 BTC

3. It is a better idea to allow mining of a bigger block immediately, 
which reduces (but not eliminates) the problem of tragedy of the 
commons. However, you can't use the blocksize as the vote. Mining an 
empty block doesn't mean the miner wants to decrease the block size to 
200 bytes. That will just encourage some miners to fill up a block with 
garbage which does no good for anyone. Therefore, you need to look at 
both the actual block size and the coinbase vote, and always take the 
bigger value to determine the penalty and the max block size of next 
round. If a miner includes nothing in the coinbase, it should be 
consider as a vote for the current max block size.

Message-ID: <CAAt2M19uCDHgMU8eFVhxuHka7aZ__9VoYtpHEp9qY5APC132Kw@mail.gmail.com>

My current idea:

* There's a scheduled hardcap that goes up over time.

* Miners vote on the blocksize limit within the hardcap, choosing the new
votecap. No particular idea for scheduling change. The 2016 block period
seems a bit long though, in case of sudden peak load.
(I'd suggest rolling vote over X blocks, enacted Y blocks later (with votes
counted from block A to block B = block A+X, the change is enacted at block
C = B+Y = A+X+Y). I'm fine with fixed-period schedules too if they span a
reasonable time, such as IMHO 2 days - we need rapid peak adjustment. No
suggestion on vote result calculation mechanism.)

* Casting votes are free.

* The mean (average) blocksize over the last time period X is calculated
for every block, or at the end of every fixed-length period (depending on
what scheduling is used for votes).

* Creating blocks larger than the mean but below the votecap raises the
difficulty target for the miner (and slightly raises the mean for future
blocks).

* The degree of difficulty raise depends on where between the mean and
votecap that the size of the given block is (and it follows that lots of
votes for large raise reduces per-extra-Kb penalty, allowing for cheaper
peak load adjustment if a large miner majority agrees). The degree of
increase may be either linear or logarithmic, I've got no suggestion
currently on any particular metric.
(Some might think this is an easy way for miners to collude to make large
blocks cheaper. If so, you could commit to only pay fee to miners that
don't vote for a block size above the size you accept, as a
counter-incentive.)

* Question: When the votecap is lowered, should the calculated mean be
forced down to follow (forcing a penalty for making blocks close to the
votecap straight after the change)? If so, how? Or should it be allowed to
fall naturally as new blocks with size below the votecap are created?

This is how miners would pay for actually creating larger blocks, and
leaves us with three methods of keeping the size in check (hardcap, votecap
and softcap). The softcap mechanism is then our third check to use if
deemed necessary (orphaning valid blocks if considered problematically
large). This third option do not need coordination with miners, they just
need to be aware which block size is accepted by the community.

I can't think of any sensible non-miner mechanism of deciding max block
size outside of using a community coordinated softcap, anything else will
not work reliably. Too hard to measure objectively and judge fairly.

The community would thus agree on a hardcap schedule in advance, and have
the option to threaten orphaning blocks via softfork later on if
circumstances would change and the votecap is too large.

I apologize, you are correct, I should not have used the word "real". 

However, if you look at section 3 of the RFC, the first hierarchal level (which in http is used to describe hosts) can be any "authority", not necessarily a hostname.

So, you could use tx, block, address, etc. as the authority for their paths.

Yes! Good point, network should be encoded. Not sure I like this format yet, but what if it was part of the authority, like block:testnet. Like http uses port 80 by default, you could have block by default refer to block:mainnet.

Eg.
blockchain://tx:testnet3/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a

I will read the RFC over more thoroughly tomorrow to get an idea of what types of things make more or less sense.

I would really prefer chain=<chainID> over network=<chainPetnameStr>
By chainID I mean the hash of the genesis block, see
https://github.com/jtimon/bitcoin/commit/3191d5e8e75687a27cf466b7a4c70bdc04809d39
I'm completely fine with doing that using an optional parameter (for
backwards compatibility).

I agree with Andreas Schildbach that respecting the most commonly used
schemes is desirable.
So my preference would be:

/tx/3b95a766d7a99b87188d6875c8484cb2b310b78459b7816d4dfc3f0f7e04281a?chain=000000000933ea01ad0ee984209779baaec3ced90fa3f408719526f8d77f4943

(a tx in testnet)

/block/00000000000000000b0d504d142ac8bdd1a2721d19f423a8146d0d6de882167b?chain=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f

Then I only care about the hard cap (for example, to me bip100 is
practically equivalent to just raise the limit to 32 MB directly).
Miners can always produce smaller blocks by modifying their local policy.
So if we need a maximum that cannot be altered by miners anyway, why
take the additional complexity of miners voting on a lower and
changing maximum size?

How expensive it is depends on the concrete function f(extra_nBits) =
extra_size_allowed
But the goal of that proposal is not to raise the size maximum
permanently, but rather temporarily allow bigger blocks when there are
spikes in demand (ie many fees to collect in unconfirmed
transactions).
Yes miners will ask that question to themselves, and the answer will
depend on the concrete function and on the fees of those extra
transactions.
The miner paying for the costs will get the gains: no tragedy of the
commons here.

I believe the tragedy of the commons actually happens with your
proposal. Why would I pay alone for something that benefits all
miners?

This seems to solve the tragedy of the commons problem with your
current proposal.
It would be like flexcap but instead of the change in size being
temporary, it affects the next maximum size permanently.
One thing to worry about is miners filling blocks with
pay-to-themselves garbage to avoid reducing the size when they don't
have enough attractive transactions to include (ie it may not be free
for the network for miners to vote on "maintain current size").

I still don't see the point in having a lower moving size maximum.
If 8 MB is mining-centralization-safe, let's move directly to 8 MB
without adding this seemingly useless extra complexity.
If it's not, mining voting on a lower moving maximum won't make it safer.

Once we have more objective tools (centralization metrics, simulators,
etc...) to determine whether or not a block size is
mining-centralization-safe for a given point in time (looking at
current centralization and current technology available), I don't see
the problem with repeating the equivalent of bip102 periodically
(every 2 years?) to adapt the size to better technology or lower
mining centralization.
It would be also helpful to have a tool to somehow measure "size
increase urgency" (ie right now free transactions get mined and blocks
aren't full or close to be full, I don't think the current general
sense of urgency on this matter is justified).

With all respect, I believe bip100 and this proposal are
over-engineering; and bip101 and bip103 (pieter's) are
overly-optimistic (in their exponential technological growth
assumptions).

O(1) propagation can never be achieved without a centralized topology.
No matter how efficient of an IBLT (or similar) we implement, O(1) can
only be achieved for transmitting a block between 2 nodes. The
propagation time of a block across the whole network (or even to the
miner's sub-network) will always depend on the concrete network
topology.

That's not to say that transmitting a block between to peers in
constant time wouldn't greatly help with mining centralization
concerns related the maximum block size, but I'm concerned about this
incorrect "O(1) block propagation" meme keeps spreading.
Even with ansibles [1] and safe zk-SNARKS [2] for constant time block
validation (somehow removing the trusted setup), both of which are
science fiction right now you need to verify the snark proof for every
node receiving and relaying the block.
At that point block propagation would be meaningless as a
miner-centralization concern for not raising the maximum block size
though: the minimum CPU costs for being able to mine profitably would
be the next concern or "bottleneck".

I completely agree with the minimum block size being inappropriate
though. I don't even believe that the stated goals of the size minimum
can be accomplished with it.

I believe it was pointed out previously in the discussion of the Peter R
paper, but I'll repeat it here so that its visible - this seems to
ignore the effects of transaction validation caches and block
compression protocols. Many large miners already have their own network
to relay blocks around the globe with only a few bytes on the wire at
block-time, and there is also the bitcoinrelaynetwork.org network, which
does the same for smaller miners, albeit with slightly less efficiency.
Also, transaction validation time upon receiving a block can be rather
easily made negligible (ie the only validation time you should have is
the DB modify-utxo-set time). Thus, the increased orphan risk for
including a transaction can be reduced to a very, very tiny amount,
making the optimal blocksize, essentially, including everything that
you're confident is in the mempool of other reasonably large miners.

As specified in BIP001, there's an optional field to link to the

You are probably right, but that is too vague for me to take any action.
Can you propose something more concrete as a PR to my branch?

Can you explain why?
I think they're helpful as examples for the explanations (even though
the concrete texts can probably improved/summarized).

I'm not sure I understand this.
What do you mean by "code forks"?
If you mean "software fork" (like libcoin or bitcoin xt
[pre-controversial-bip101]) those are completely fine and out of scope
for this BIP, since they don't require coordination by the different

I don't think the spell checking had been followed at all for this or
any other BIP, but yes, Greg assigned the number 99 (he did so
privately instead of here on this thread, which I find very annoying
because you are the second person who complains about this).

That is a good question. The proposal currently says "informational |
process": https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/181/files#diff-e331b8631759a4ed6a4cfb4d10f473caR6
But I wasn't really convinced about this so I'm happy to change it to
whatever it's more appropriate.
The contained code is an example of an uncontroversial hardfork to
create a precedent. I'm not sure I understand your proposal for a
"patch into core as a module that hard forks can use in the future".
Can you elaborate what would go in that patch?

In fact I have been accused in the past (by at least Peter Todd) of
having "too many cases in mind" or "doing refactors that are good for
altchains".
That's why I'm very cautious about proposing changes that are not
strict improvments in maintainability to bitcoin itself.
But I actually have freicoin, sidechains and private chains (defined
in freimarkets, used in elements alpha as "block signing") in mind.
Some of the consensus changes I have in mind are support for multiple
assets or interest-bearing assets, for example.
But if you need to change the consensus rules you need to change the
code, there's no way around that.
It will be much simpler to only adapt libconsensus to other chains
than it is to adapt the whole Bitcoin Core code base.
Libconsensus can free you from the need of running "border routers"
(which you need to adapt if you depend on them and are supporting
chains with different rules).
When libconsensus has it's own independent repository, will I fork the
project to have a multi-consensus library supporting multiple
different chains (apart from bitcoin and its testchains)? Maybe, I'm
not sure it makes sense, maybe it's just simpler to maintain a
different project for each different chain (ie libfreicoinconsensus,
libbetaconsensus, etc).

That is very sad to hear. The main reason to integrate libconsensus is
to avoid consensus fork bugs (or to not depend on the "border routers"
to avoid those bugs).

That's out of scope for libconsensus which will be stateless and whose
only API would be in C.
But the refactors in Bitcoin Core will hopefully make it easier to
support such a minimal node in it (you know you can "./configure
--disable-wallet --without-gui" already, right?, about RPC, that's the
remaining API!).

Yes, and the wheel it's an invention used in pre-historic times: that
doesn't make it less useful.
Do you have any other suggestion for interfacing with external storage
using a C API?

Hello Matt and Daniele,

The effect of block compression protocols is included.  This is what I call the "coding gain" and use the Greek letter "gamma" to represent. 

As long as the block solution announcements contain information (i.e., Shannon Entropy) about the transactions included in a block, then the fee market will be "healthy" according to the definitions given in the linked paper (see below).  This is the case right now, this is the case with your relay network, and this would be the case using any implementation of IBLTs that I can imagine, so long as miners can still construct blocks according to their own volition.  The "healthy fee market" result follows from the Shannon-Hartley theorem; the SH-theorem describes the maximum rate at which information (Shannon Entropy) can be transmitted over a physical communication channel.   

 https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43331625/feemarket.pdf

I've exchanged emails with Greg Maxwell about (what IMO is) an academic scenario where the block solutions announcements contain no information at all about the transactions included in the blocks.  Although the fee market would not be healthy in such a scenario, it is my feeling that this also requires miners to relinquish their ability to construct blocks according to their own volition (i.e., the system would already be centralized).  I look forward to a white paper demonstrating otherwise!

Best regards,
Peter

I completely agree and I share your frustration.
The importance of modularization is often disregarded but in my
opinion it has a deep positive impact in the long term: more people
are able to contribute with code and review (in the areas they know
better), the risks associated with each change become more clear
(there was a time when almost any change implied consensus risks),
more alternative code bases can be implemented on top of the basic
ones without fear of consensus bugs, etc.

When I first read some of the code in 2011, I concluded that almost
everything was in main.cpp (which I found ridiculous from a software
engineering perspective). When I started to contribute with code in
2014, main.cpp was still (and still is in my opinion) giant, but the
modularization had greatly improved thanks to changes like moving the
serialization code out of main (thank you very much for that). We
still have a lot of work ahead, but we've certainly advanced a lot.

Unfortunately we cannot force reviewers to pay more attention to
modularization PRs, many of them are usually more interested in
changes that add or remove functionality in the short term. This
problem gets exacerbated when modularization changes are required to
be done in small increments to make them more easily reviewable and
less disruptive to other open PRs, since it's harder for people to see
the big picture and the rationale for those small changes (that often
don't hcange functionality or performance at all).

I know we are not alone on this and people like Wladimir, Pieter, Cory
and Jonas Schnelli (at least, probably more people do) deeply care
about modularization, even if I subjectively and selfishly interpret
the lack of review on some of my PRs as a symptom of the opposite.
So I suggest that people who think this is a high priority join and
review each other's PRs on the subject.

Currently I focus on 3 modularization areas:

1) Chainparams: supporting multiple chains (ie multiple testchains is
all what Bitcoin cares about) is a great goal but there's still many
barriers to create a new testchain. I started this work with #3824,
but even after #6382 there are still more things to do.

2) Consensus: separating the consensus code, Matt Corallo had the idea
of also exposing it in libconsensus. I started with #3839, the latest
things I still have open are #6591 and #6445, please review.

3) Policy: separate node local policy code. Luke Dashjr started with
#5071, I started with #6335 (after several failed attempts), the next
little step blocking many other changes I have ready for way too long
is #6068 (#6424 also helps), please review.

I know Jonas Schnelli is focusing on the wallet. Cory Fields has
recently focused on checkpoints and chainparams.

Now that I know that you also care about modularization I will ask you
for review as well, I hope not to be too annoying like I've been with
Wladimir and Cory some times (and I usually am with some of my
coworkers at blockstream). Please do the same with me: point me to any
modularization PR you have opened.

Regarding your next post, I agree that an additional "Layer" field in
BIPs could be useful. Maybe you should start a BIP for that?

I plan to replicate the RPC API (or a subset of it) using ZMQ's
req/rep pattern, but #6103 comes first.

Well, the RPC is the API. For libconsensus, its C API is the API.
We've been talking about separating the wallet and qt to a different
repository for long, but modularization is a prerequisite.

Concept ACK. As suggested in the other thread, maybe it is worth to
start a new BIP draft for this?

Dear Greg,

I am moving our conversation into public as I've recently learned that you've been forwarding our private email conversation verbatim without my permission [I received permission from dpinna to share the email that proves this fact: http://pastebin.com/jFgkk8M3].
> Greg wrote to Peter R:  "You know that your "proof" of this problematic-- outright false under the discussion we had, or at least likely of little pratical relevance under reasonable, pratical assumptions.  But you respond to dpinna agreeing with him and not cautioning him on relying on these
> 
The proof is not "problematic."  Right now you're providing an example of what Mike Hearn refers to as "black-and-white" thinking.  Just because the proof makes simplifying assumptions, doesn't mean it's not useful in helping us to understand the dynamics of the transaction fee market.  Proofs about physical systems need to make simplifying assumptions because the physical world is messy (unlike the world of pure math).  

My proof assumes very reasonably that block solutions contain information (i.e., Shannon Entropy) about the transactions included in a block.  As long as this is true, and as long as miners act rationally to maximize their profit, then the fee market will remain "healthy" according to the definitions given in my paper.  This is the case right now, this is the case with the Relay Network, and this would be the case using any implementation of IBLTs that I can imagine, so long as miners retain the ability to construct blocks according to their own volition.  The "healthy fee market" result follows from the Shannon-Hartley theorem; the SH-theorem describes the maximum rate at which information (Shannon Entropy) can be transmitted over a physical communication channel.   

You are imagining an academic scenario (to use your own words: "perhaps of little practical relevance") where all of the block solutions announcements contain no information at all about the transactions included in the blocks.  Although I agree that the fee market would not be healthy in such a scenario, it is my feeling that this also requires miners to relinquish their ability to construct blocks according to their own volition (i.e., the system would already be centralized).  I look forward to reading a white paper where you show:

(a) Under what assumptions/requirements such a communication scheme is physically possible.

(b) That such a configuration is not equivalent to a single entity[1] controlling >50% of the hash power.

(c) That the network moving into such a configuration is plausible.

Lastly, I'd like to conclude by saying that we are all here trying to learn about this new amazing thing called Bitcoin.  Please go ahead and write a paper that shows under what network configuration my results don't hold.  I'd love to read it!  This is how we make progress in science!!

Sincerely, 
Peter

[1] For example, if--in order to achieve such a configuration with infinite coding gain--miners can no longer choose how to structure their blocks according to their own volition, then I would classify those miners as slaves rather than as peers, and the network as already centralized.

Some altcoins (LTC and FTC for example) have the same genesis block hash.

That's obviously a design mistake in FTC, but it's not unsolvable. FTC
could move their genesis block to the next block (or the first one that is
not identical to LTC's).

Bitcoin and all its test chains have different genesis blocks, so I'm not
sure FTC should be a concern for a BIP anyway...

It is not a purely academic scenario that blocks contain effectively no
information (that was not previously relayed). I'm not aware of any
public code to do so, but I know several large miners who pre-relay the
block(s) they are working on to other nodes of theirs around the globe.
This means at announce-time you have only a few bytes to broadcast (way
less than a packet, and effects of using smaller packets to relay things
vs larger packets are very small, if anything). After you've broadcast
to all of your nodes, hops to other mining nodes are probably only a
handful of ms away with very low packet loss, so relay time is no longer
connected to transaction inclusion at all (unless you're talking about
multi-GB blocks). Of course, this is relay time for large miners who can
invest time and money to build such systems. Small miners are completely
screwed in such a system.

Thus, the orphan risk for including a transaction is related to the
validation time (which is only DB modify-utxo-set time, essentially,
which maybe you can optimize much of that away, too, and only have to
pass over mempool or so). Anyway, my point, really, is that though
miners will have an incentive to not include transactions which will
trigger validation by other nodes (ie things not already in their
mempool), the incentive to not include transactions which have already
been relayed around sufficiently is, while not theoretically zero, as
near to zero in practice as you can get.

Of course this assumes the network does not change any as a result of
such a system. But such a system provides strong incentives for the
network to centralize in other ways (put all the mining nodes in one DC
for all miners, etc).

Hello Matt,

The results of my paper hold unless the information about the included transactions is identically zero.  If this information is extremely small, then I agree that something other than the orphan cost would drive the fee market. I don't think this will ever by the case, however.

In this paragraph, you are talking about intra-miner communication (you refer to other nodes "of theirs").   I agree that this can be very fast because there's only one entity involved.

I look forward to hearing your talk about the Relay Network.  Let's image there was no block size limit.  Using the Relay Network as it currently operates now, how big would the block solution announcement be:

(1) if a miner published a 10 MB block where 100% of the transactions are known by the other nodes?  

(2) if a miner published a 10 MB block where 90% of the transactions are known by the other nodes?  

(3) if a miner published a 100 MB spam block where 0% of the transactions are known by the other nodes?

Best regards,
Peter

If all the mining nodes are in one data center, and if all the nodes are programmed to build blocks in essentially the same way, then I would agree that the orphan cost would be negligible!  I will add this as an example of a network configuration where the results of my paper would be less relevant.

Unfortunately, your work extensive as it was made at least two
non-disclosed or poorly-disclosed simplifying assumptions and a significant
system understanding error which, I believe, undermined it completely.

In short these were:

* You assume miners do not have the ability to change their level
centralization.

 -- In fact they do, not just in theory but in pratice have responded
    to orphaning this way in the past; and it is one of the major
    concerns in this space.

* You assume the supply of bitcoin is infinite (that subsidy never
declines)

 -- It declines geometrically, and must if the 21m limit is to be upheld.
    (Though I think this is not equally important as the other concerns)

* You argue, incorrectly, that amount of information which must be
transmitted at the moment a block is discovered is proportional to the
block's size.

 -- Instead the same information can be transmitted _in advance_, as
 has been previously proposed, and various techniques can make doing
 so arbitrarily efficient.

[I would encourage anyone who is interested to read the posted off-list
discussion]

I contacted you in private as a courtesy in the hope that it would be
a more productive pathway to improving our collective understanding; as well
as a courtesy to the readers of the list in consideration of traffic levels.

In one sense, this was a success: Our conversation concluded with you
enumerating a series of corrective actions that you would take:

--------

To the best of my knowledge, you've taken none of these corrective
actions in the nearly month that has passed.  I certainly understand being
backlogged, but you've also continued to make public comments about your
work seemingly (to me) in contradiction with the above corrective actions.

Today I discovered that another author spent their time extending your
work and wasn't made aware of these points.  A result was that the other
author's work may require significant revisions.

I complained about this to you, again privately, and your (apparent)
response was to post to that thread stating that there was a
details-unspecified academic disagreement with me and "I look forward
to a white paper demonstrating otherwise!", in direct contradiction to
your remarks to me three weeks ago in private correspondence: In private
you said that your model may only hold in an asymptotic sense and that
"the phenomena in the paper (may) be negligible compared to the dynamics
from some other effect"; but in public you said /my/ position was
"academic".

At this point I thought continuing to withhold this information from
the other author was unreasonable and no longer justified by courtesy
to you, and I forwarded our complete discussion to the other author
with the comment "I'll forward you a set of private correspondence
that I've had with Peter R.  I would recommend you take the time to
read it and consider it.".

I apologize if in doing so I've breached your confidence, none of the
material we discussed was a sort that I would have ordinarily considered
private, and you had already talked about making the product of our
communication published as part of your corrective actions.
I do not think it would be reasonable to demand that I spent time
repeating the same discussion again with the other author, or deprive
them of your side of it and/or the corrective actions which you had
said you would take but have not yet taken.

(In fact, I would argue that you were already obligated to share at least the
substance of the discussion  with the other author, both as part of your
commitment to me as well it being necessiary for intellectual progress.)

As you say, 'we are all here trying to learn about this new amazing
thing called Bitcoin'; and I'm not embarrassed to error towards doing
that and aiding others in doing so, but at the same time I am sorry
to have done so in a way which caused you some injury.

In any case, your prior proposed corrective actions seemed sufficient to me.

It surprises me, greatly, that you are failing to see the extreme
practicality of what I described to you, and that it does not meaningfully
diminish miner control of transaction selection-- but even without it your
remark that the proportionality could be arbitrarily small (Rather than
0, as I argue) is an adequate correction to your work, in my view.

I believe my time would be better spent actually _implementing_ improved
relaying described (and describe what was implemented) than continue
a purely academic debate with you over the (IMO) inconsequential difference
between epsilon and zero.

You missed one key point - information transmitted across networks is
not slowed down on a per-bit basis, its (largely) slowed down on a
per-packet basis! You have some 1400+ bytes to work with before you
notice the increase in information in relay cost. Of course this only

countries, etc), if you're talking about short links it is a per-byte

Very fast is an understatement. My point was that it is literally always

I think you missed it, this mail was not about the relay network. Let's
ignore the relay network entirely for now. Several miners have nodes
well distributed all over the globe which peer either directly with
other miners in the area, or just connect to a ton of nodes, probably
hitting other miners. The cost to transmit from their pool server to
their relay server is one packet, always. They pre-relay everything
they're gonna include, so, at max, they might have to pick between a few
pre-relayed blocks (what, like, 2/5 bits?). From there, you assume they
are transmitting to a node in the same DC, or at least very close (say,
local within AWS-US-East/maybe between AWS-US-East and somewhere in
NYC), where transmitting even 100MB is really fast.

I agree that miners may change their level of centralization.  This neither affects the model nor the results presented in the paper.

No I don't.  I assume the inflation rate is R/T, where R is a variable.  

The last paragraph of the conclusion speaks to the paradox of what happens when R -> 0 as an area for future research.

I assume, very reasonably, that the block solutions contain information about the transactions included in the block.  This is the case today, this is the case using the relay network, and this would be the case using any compression scheme I can personally imagine actually occurring in the future.  

(I've always agreed that if block solutions can be communicated to all of the hash power in such a way that they don't include any information about the transactions they contain, then the conditions for a healthy fee market would not be met [this would be gamma --> infinity in my model]).

I appreciated the discussion we were having and I thought we had come to some kind of an understanding.  I acknowledged that when I made the other corrections to my paper that I would further clarify the assumptions (I agreed that the presentation could be improved).      

What was not courteous was that you forwarded the entire private email chain to other people without my permission.

I stand by all of these four points.  My paper wasn't perfectly presented.  Making these clarifications will strengthen the manuscript by showing how strong the claim "a healthy transaction fee market exists without a block size limit" is.

My public comments have been factual.  I've even gone out of my way in several public threads to point out your objection that the coding gain could be zero (even though I think it is flawed "black-and-white thinking" about an academic scenario that will never unfold and might actually be physically impossible without Bitcoin already being centralized).

I'll end by saying that I am the one describing things as the presently are.  You are talking about a hypothetical future that may or may not exist (and may not even be possible).  The results of my paper logically follow from the assumptions made. You think the assumption that "block solutions contain information about the transactions included in the block" will not hold in the future.  Can you show:

(a) Under what assumptions/requirements your communication scheme is physically possible.

(b) That such a configuration is not equivalent to a single entity[1] controlling >50% of the hash power.

(c) That the network moving into such a configuration is plausible.

Best regards,
Peter

It has tremdous significance to the real-world impact of your results.

If not for the other errors in your work, this point would make the
take away of your work not "a healthy transaction fee market exists
without a block size limit" but rather "a decenteralized bitcoin
cannot exist"-- as, accepting the other errors as fact your model
shows that centralizing mining is always strictly more profitable at
any level of fee demand; because your model equivilent shows that for
any level of fee demand and gamma miners could increase their income
by centeralizing further.

I absolutely agree that simplifications are useful and essential, but
it is critically important to call them out before someone mistakes
theoretical work as useful motivation for policy in the non-simplified
system.

This assumption is unreasonable, and does not-- in fact-- accurately
reflect the situation today.

For example it does not reflect how hashers return work to pools
_today_ (and since 2011) as they so to only by referencing the merkel
root... the pool already knows the  transaction set. In that
particular case it knows it because it selected it to begin with, but
the same behavior holds if the hasher selects the transaction set and
sends it first.

It only _very_ weakly reflects how the relay protocol works (only the
selection and permutation is communicated; not the transaction data
itself; for already known transactions). Even if you assume nothing
more than that (in spite of the existing reality) you have not shown
that the compressed data must be linear in the size of the block.

It does not reflect how P2Pool works (which also sends the
transactions in advance).

There is a simple, and intuitive understanding that does not require
any complex supposition:  You argue that the information must be
transfered when a block is found, thus delaying it.  I point out, no,
any required information (to the extent that there is any at all after
efficient encoding) can be sent in advance of the block.

I believe that you've allowed the fact that the specifc example block
relay protocol doesn't bother sending _all_ information in advance to
confuse it for mere compression.

I believe my reponses are firmly grounded in the physical reality of
actually deployed systems and constructable protocols.

By comparison, even if I were to agree that the bound is not actually
exactly 0 proporionality  you have already agreed that with
"compression" the amount sent could be arbritarily low. The result
being that the behavior you're describing would only be asymptoic and
have no relationship to the actual Bitcoin system that exists in a
finite universe.

But you continue to demand debate over this meaningless point.

Pratically every block today is mined under a protocol which does not
need to communicate anything but constant data when a block is found.

I am getting a little tired of people suggesting things which are
widely deployed are not physically possible.

Yes, that particular example is not the most powerful form of that
idea-- but it has the benefit of _universal_ use.

> (b) That such a configuration is not equivalent to a single entity[1]
> controlling >50% of the hash power.

I find this a little amusing. Even in this messsage you defend
ignoring of centeralization considerations in your paper. But here ask
that I address concerns which you refused to suggest. Why do you
demand my correction use weaker assumptions than your work?

That said-- I already gave you a fairly concrete description of a
pratical protocol which would accomplish your requirement ( (a) reduce
the information transmitted in a latency critical way at block
discovery time to O(1) network wide, (b) without creating
centeralization in chain or transaction selection). I believe my
description in the messages was adequate that anyone working on
Bitcoin Core could go implement a version of it, at least.  You appear
to have simply ignrored it.

If the actual technical details made your eyes glaze over I also
offered a simple intutive understanding:  The no proportional
information need be transfered at the latency critical time, because
it can be transfered in _advance_. Everything beyond that is just
efficiency optimizations to reduce the cost of doing the advanced
transmission.

> (c) That the network moving into such a configuration is plausible.

That it already uses advanced information techniques in every widely
used mining protocol, that the relay protocol was rapidly adopted, and
that your own model would suggest significant profits from any such
improvement would seem to remove any doubt related to (c)... and again
here you hold me to a higher bar than your own work: as nowhere do you
show that the "limits" your model erroniously extracts are plausable
as limits, and in private you seemed to admit to me that they may well
not be.

I don't really see any problem with the paper:
All it states is that having the assumption that miners don't
centralize, transaction fees don't go to zero even without the
blocksize limit. I think we can accept this as a nice academic
research, and I believe that it's true.
Still, it doesn't have anything that is practical for me as an user of
the Bitcoin network (I use it for storing long-term purchase value, as
most of the people who I know): it doesn't help me if I still need to
pay transaction fees after the blocksize limit is gone. My (and other
users') main concern is about centralization, which has nothing to do
with transaction fees. I would be OK with $100 transaction fee as
well, as long as the network is fair and secure (which comes from
decentralization).

The paper makes no claims about "miners changing their level of centralization."  Whether it is or is not significant, it is outside the scope of the paper and irrelevant to the result that a fee market exists without a block size limit (given the assumption that some information about the transactions included in a block is communicated between miners during block solution propagation).      

> If not for the other errors in your work,

Again, what you are calling "errors" are assumptions--in fact very reasonable assumptions that we know are valid for the network as a whole right now.  You are proposing that maybe they won't be valid in the future if the miners move to some hypothetical configuration that you worry may be possible.  I say prove it: show rigorously what the network would look like in a case where information about the transactions contained in a block is never communicated with the block solution.  How do you get the miners to agree (assuming such a configuration is even physically possible)?  Do you need all the miners to agree or only a portion of them?  How reasonable is it that the systems moves into such a configuration?  I know you spoke to this in your last response, but I mean really prove it...with a mathematical model, with diagrams and charts, with equations, with your assumptions clearly stated so that they can be put to the test--not by waving your hands on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.    

This is an exciting field of research and we should encourage people to continue to explore these questions.

OK, I actually sort of agree with your very last sentence above.  My paper indeed suggests that the most "profitable" configuration is one where there is only one "super pool." Is that likely to happen?  I personally don't think so because of the game theory involved.  But regardless of my opinion or your opinion on that matter, whether it is or isn't likely to happen is outside the scope of my paper.  It is irrelevant to the result that a fee market exists without a block size limit given the assumption that there is more than a single miner.

I do call them out.  Furthermore, I've already agreed with you to further clarify these assumptions when I make the other corrections to the paper.  Doing so will make the paper stronger.  

I'm not going to address the remainder of your email because I believe that we are now talking past each other.  I do appreciate the interest and attention that you've paid to my work on the Transaction Fee Market, and I also recognize the important contributions you've made such as coinjoin and HD wallets.  

Best regards,
Peter

Message-ID: <CAEgR2PGsOgdTKMXAabeRZfREciTntj9uaBDLPuFz84rUoSVSLw@mail.gmail.com>

I think that the argument for Peter's optimal block construction algorithm
(leading to the definition of the Fee Demand Curve) is that in the limit of
a mempool with a very large number of transactions, you should be able to
assume that for any given transaction [image: i] of size [image: s_i] and
fee density [image: \phi_i], many transactions [image: j] will exist such
that [image: s_j<s_i] and [image: \phi_j=\phi_i]. This means that, in
solving the knapsack problem, one has the choice of including what
effectively amounts to fractions of transactions. This in turn results in
an unbounded knapsack problem for which Peter's greedy algorithm is an
asymptotically optimal solution.

Obviously this breaks down in small mempool scenarios where the
discreteness of transactions can not be washed away (such as the current
state of the network).

I hope this clarifies your point.

This was pointed out to me by Tom Harding.

Choosing what the optimal way of choosing transactions to be included in a
block is a knapsack problem (an NP-complete problem!):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem

For which your suggested solution, which is by no means exact, is known as
the "Greedy Approximation Algorithm". This algorithm in turn works best
only when a very large quantity of high density transactions is available
in the mempool.

This wouldn't invalidate your proof but it may significantly alter the
optimal block size value.

Just thought I would throw this your way.

Daniele --

Thanks!  I printed it and read the whole thing.  It's really a great step
forward building on the Peter R paper. The conclusions are enticing.  I'm
looking forward to understanding it in more detail and participating in the
discussion.

I find your work to be rational and scholarly without being obscure,
pedantic, or getting caught up in unimportant details.  It has a long-term
focus.


"The optimal strategy, ?rst analyzed in [3]"  I don't recall whether Peter
R considered constrained block space or not, but if it is considered,
simple fee-density prioritization is not necessarily optimal (it is a
knapsack problem).

Hello Tom, Daniele --

Thank you Tom for pointing out the knapsack problem to all of us.  I will include a note about it when I make the other corrections to the Fee Market paper.

I agree with what Daniele said previously.  The other "non-greedy" solutions to the knapsack problem are most relevant when one is choosing from a smaller number of items where certain items have a size similar to the size of the knapsack itself.  For example, these other solutions would be useful if transactions were often 50 kB, 100 kB, 400 kB in size, and we were trying to find the optimal TX set to fit into a 1 MB block.  

However, since the average transaction size is ~500 bytes, even with a block size limit of 1 MB, we are looking at up to 2000 transactions.  The quantization effects become small.  Rather than 22 triangles as shown in Fig. 3 (http://imgur.com/rWxZddg), there are hundreds or a few thousands, and we can reasonably approximate the discrete set of points as a continuous curve.  Like Daniele pointed out, the greedy algorithm assumed in the paper is asymptotically optimal in such a case.

Best regards,
Peter

This is based on the assumption that miners would always like to use up 
the last byte of the available block size. However, this is just not 
true:

1. The 6 year blockchain history has shown that most miners have a soft 
cap with their block size.

2. Chinese miners, controlling 60% of the network, rejected Gavin's 
initial 20MB proposal and asked for 8MB: 
http://cointelegraph.com/news/114577/chinese-mining-pools-propose-alternative-8-mb-block-size

3. BTCChina supports BIP100 and will vote for 2MB at the beginning, with 
8MB as a mid-term goal: 
https://vip.btcchina.com/page/noticetemplate?id=100.
BTCChina is controlling 12% of the network in the past month. If BIP100 
uses the 20-percentile vote as the block size, it takes only 8% more 
vote to keep the size at 2MB

For many reasons miners may want to have a smaller block size, which we 
don't need to list them here. Although they can limit it by a softfork 
or even 51% attack, it is a very violent process. Why don't we just 
allow them to vote for a lower limit?

So I think the right way is to choose a mining-centralization-safe 
limit, and let it free float within a range based on miner's vote. If we 
are lucky enough to have some responsible miners, they will keep it as 
low as possible, until the legitimate tx volume catches up. Even in the 
worst case, the block size is still mining-centralization-safe. The 
upper limit may increase linearly, if not exponentially, until we find a 
better long-term solution. (sort of a combination of BIP100 and 101, 
with different parameters)

--------
For the matter of "urgency", I agree with you that there is no actual 
urgency AT THIS MOMENT. However, if a hardfork may take 5 years to 
deploy (as you suggested), we really have the urgency to make a decision 
now. Actually, the main point is not urgency but uncertainty. We have 
debated for 5 years. Why won't we have 5 more years of debate, plus 5 
years of deployment delay? Are we sticking to 1MB for 10 years? In that 
case Bitcoin Core must be abandoned by the economic majority and a 
Schism fork must occur.

Message-ID: <CAGLBAhe7c7qnT4zySXz=M8AYTAZfVfDCUfby8bOi_FKoSV4mFA@mail.gmail.com>

Before miners get angry, consider that whatever the community does will
attempt to preserve the efforts you have made to make Bitcoin a success.
Paragraph five, below, includes a provision to protect you, so please don't
write me off.

The competition is essential to protecting the data in the blockchain.  I
worry that any time (eg all time so far) the rules of that competition
remain static, a group of people willing to develop and optimize hardware
that performs the work will form, and their products will find a following
- the miners.  These miners and hardware producers will advance the
technology until the cost of competing in the space is so high that mining
bitcoin is, for all practical purposes, centralized.

I propose that the proof of work algorithm be scheduled to change
periodically.  The current definition is pretty simple and there's no
reason not to continue using simple definitions.  We could develop a list
of hash algorithms which could be indexed so that the first few bits of the
difficulty-change block's hash (or even *every* block's hash) could be used
to select one to be used for the next block.  The principle is to
discourage specialization of hardware designed for what we must admit is an
arbitrary computing exercise, intended only to enable competition.

Of course chip designers could start working on hardware that can handle
all the algorithms defined, but the protocol can also warn them that from
time to time, the community will alter the content of the list of hash
algorithms, specifically to ensure that *general purpose *computing
machines (ie, what the average tech aficionado will have) is the best
device for mining bitcoin.

If such a variable PoW were to be used, I recommend that most of the
elements in the initial list of algorithms be the current PoW algorithm so
that most blocks can be solved by the existing mining community, and only
one every now and then will be available to everyone else.  Over time, that
ratio would fall, giving the miners time to convert their expertise into
more productive activities.

I refer you to the stories at the beginning of each chapter of Douglas
Hofstadter's
G?del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, a few of which describe a
competition between a record-player-making tortoise and Achilles, who works
on making records that break the record players.  It offers some through
provoking musings that can easily be related to this thing Satoshi made.

No, I'm not making such assumption. I'm focusing on what they CAN do,
while suspending judgement on their good will and not trying to
predict their future behavior from historic behaviour.
With 60% of the hashrate, you can easily get 100% by orphaning
everybody else's blocks. More importantly, being under the same
jurisdiction they can be forced to behave in certain way (for example,
censor transactions) by law.
I'm very worried about the current situation no matter how benevolent
current miners are. Thus weakening the only limit to mining
centralization that we have at the consensus rule level seems
extremely risky at this point.

My point is, a "soft cap" determined by miners clearly doesn't protect
us from mining centralization: the "hard cap" does.
Knowing that, and given that miners can currently set their own policy
block size maximum, what does this "voting on a lower limit" achieve?
What are the gains? Why are we "lucky" if they keep the lower one as
low as possible?

Thank you for admitting it is not urgent!
I suggested 5 years for the concrete hardfork in bip99 because it's
clearly non-urgent and I wanted to be very conservative. I'm happy to
reduce that to say, 1 year (specially given that the change is very
simple to implement).
For a simple block size change (like, say bip102) 1 year (maybe 6
months + miner's confirmation) is probably more than enough as well.
And we can always deploy an urgency hardfork if it is necessary.

Fortunately we haven't been discussing this for 5 years, I don't know
where you get that from.
A schism fork it's certainly always a possibility but I would only
consider it after an urgency hardfork (once the issue becomes urgent)
fails due to not being uncontroversial.
Would you agree with me on that?
What would be your criterion for considering an increase in block size urgent?

Mine is: we should consider a block increase only when minimum market
fees for transactions to be mined (currently zero satoshis) increase
above a high fee (admittedly undefined, but certainly greater than
zero).
Even if it's "urgent", I think we should only increase the maximum if,
at the same time, the new size can be considered safe
mining-centralization-wise (unfortunately we don't have any metric to
measure that nor enough tools to realistically simulate different
sizes in different network topologies at the moment). But once we have
them, the next discussion will be much simpler, so I don't see the
need for block size maximum that changes over time (neither
exponentially nor linearly).

Would you agree with me that mining centralization should be the most
important criterion when changing the block size maximum rule rather
than the level of minimum fees?
If the community can't agree on this, I'm afraid there will be a
schism hardfork eventually. Another possibility is that those who
aren't concerned with mining centralization start their own altcoin
(centralizedcoin? ), maybe a spinoff [
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0 ] if they want to
keep Bitcoin's utxo at the moment of the separation.

But if the community agrees with this and just disagrees on the
maximum block size consensus rule having any effect on mining
centralization (like Gavin and I disagree), we should calm down and
use scientific processes to find out what the relation between the two
actually is (if there's any relation at all).

Would you agree with me on this?

Hi Wei,

As you know, I'm not a developer of Bitcoin-Qt, but we'll need to make our
best guesses for these answers if the developers won't reply. I'm going to
post my best guesses here so that people reading the list have a short
window of opportunity to correct me if they wish.

No, Bitcoin-Qt does not try to make non-mixing transactions look like
mixing transactions.

Not yet BIP 69. These notes suggest that outputs are randomized:

Unknown

Here's a detailed answer on stack exchange:
http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/35904/how-much-of-bip-62-dealing-with-malleability-has-been-implemented

By item, my extremely brief interpretation:

Non-DER encoded ECDSA signatures: BIP66 soft fork has happened, so this is
presumed to be implemented
Non-push operations in scriptSig: Implemented
Push operations in scriptSig of non-standard size type: Implemented in 0.9.0
Zero-padded number pushes: Implemented in 0.10.0 (current available version
is 0.11.0)
Inherent ECDSA signature malleability: ...implemented?
Superfluous scriptSig operations: implemented 0.6.0
Inputs ignored by scripts: Only partly addressed by 0.10.0.  It appears
that the rest would require changes to consensus rules, so Bitcoin-Qt is as
compliant as it can be.
Sighash flags based masking and New signatures by the sender: Can't be
implemented without changes to consensus rules.

I would summarize this as a "yes."

100%, unless a user bootstraps downloading the blockchain. Bootstrapping

downloaded that bootstrap.dat file.

If Tor is set up as a SOCKS proxy, you can configure Bitcoin-QT download
the blockchain and broadcast txs through a single Tor circuit. This can be
configured once before opening Bitcoin-Qt.

No, you can only configure a single proxy.

No built-in support for multiple identities. You can hotswap wallet files
to crudely simulate this. You'd have to manually change the Tor connection
outside of Bitcoin-Qt to create the effect of making the network
connections independent.

Blocks are downloaded and tx broadcasts received/relayed rather than
querying the utxo set for a particular address. When swapping between
wallet files, some information may be leaked e.g. the client may be at the
same block height in terms of what it has downloaded from the p2p network,
which may leak to global passive adversaries/AS's or sybil attackers the
fact that a single client was used for multiple wallets.

Transactions from multiple identities would not be routed at the same time.
I'm not clear what happens if you have a single wallet (identity) open and
then open a new wallet (identity) without closing Bitcoin-Qt -- some of the
same routing paths may still be used such that an attacker might observe
transactions broadast signed by private keys from multiple wallets
(identities) and observe that they appear to come from the same wallet
client. OBPP should assume the worst unless prevented contrary evidence.

Identity is primarily tied to a wallet.dat file. Deleting it will remove
most of the evidence that the wallet was installed on that device, but
there may be some extra information in ancillary files that should also be
deleted.  This is an OS-level function, as there is no operation built into
the client to delete a wallet file (identity).

No. Backups are local, and no email or SMS is linked. No web queries
related to backup.

No

Yes, some connections to known p2p full nodes to bootstrap the connection
to the Bitcoin p2p network. This is configurable, but there are defaults.
An ISP is likely to be able to identify a customer as running the
Bitcoin-Qt client in particular on this basis.

BIP12 specifies format for user agents:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0014.mediawiki

It appears that the Bitcoin-QT leaks specific information about its client
version through User Agent. This file defines the current client version:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/55294a9fb673ab0a7c99b9c18279fe12a5a07890/src/clientversion.h

Various other files seem to use this to build up the UA string, which is
transmitted to other peers.

Probably depends on the platform. Last time I checked, I think Bitcoin-Qt
leaves behind a .bitcoin directory on most platforms even after you run an
uninstall script.

You can encrypt the wallet file with a password. The wallet is "locked"
until the password is entered, preventing decryption of the private keys.

No -- any wallet.dat file can be opened and the public keys inspected

No -- any wallet.dat file can be opened and the metadata inspected without

Message-ID: <CAEgR2PE35K6kt1sZ0iDu2Y9vv+6+Omgg_n4n3gtMggYuE3YD-g@mail.gmail.com>

Since my longer post seems to be caught in moderator purgatory I will
rehash its results into this much smaller message. I apologize for the
spamming.

I present a theorem whose thesis is obvious to many.

*THESIS: All hashrates* *h' > h generate a revenue per unit of hash v' >
v. *

Let us absurdly[1] assume that an optimal hashrate *h* exists where the
average revenue for each hash in service is maximized. This will result
from perpetually mining blocks of size *q,* is *v. *All larger hashrates *h'
> h* will generate an average revenue per hash *v' < v*(effectively the
conclusion of my paper) due to the higher orphan risk carried from having
to mine blocks of size *q' > q*. Leading from Peter's model and my
analysis, the origin of this balance lies in the fact that larger miners
must somehow be forced to mine larger blocks which in turn carry a larger
orphan risk.

What happens if a large miner *h'* chooses not to mine his optimal block
size *q' *in favor of a seemingly "sub-optimal" block size* q*?
Since he mines a block of identical size as the smaller miner, they will
both carry identical orphan risks[2], and win identical
amounts*R+M(q)* whenever
they successfully mine a block. Since the larger miner can statistically
expect to win *h'/h* more blocks than the smaller miner, they will each
earn an identical revenue per unit of hash *R+M(q)/h*.

This however directly contradicts the assumption that an optimal hashrate
exists beyond which the revenue per unit of hash *v' < v*if  *h' > h. *
*Q.E.D *

This theorem in turn implies the following corollary:

*COROLLARY: **The marginal profit curve is a monotonically increasing of
miner hashrate.*

This simple theorem, suggested implicitly by Gmaxwell disproves any and all
conclusions of my work. Most importantly, centralization pressures will
always be present.

Furthermore,

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum
[2] Orphan risks will actually favor the larger hashrate miner leading to
greater revenues per unit of hash.

I thank the dev-list for its valuable time and exchange on the subject
matter. I stand by for any further comments and questions.

Hi Daniele,

I don't think there is any contention over the idea that miners that control a larger percentage of the hash rate, h / H, have a profitability advantage if you hold all the other variables of the miner's profit equation constant.  I think this is important: it is a centralizing factor similar to other economies of scale.  

However, that is outside the scope of the result that an individual miner's profit per block is always maximized at a finite block size Q* if Shannon Entropy about each transaction is communicated during the block solution announcement.  This result is important because it explains how a minimum fee density exists and it shows how miners cannot create enormous spam blocks for "no cost," for example.  

Best regards,
Peter

"However, that is outside the scope of the result that an individual
miner's profit per block is always maximized at a finite block size Q* if
Shannon Entropy about each transaction is communicated during the block
solution announcement.  This result is important because it explains how a
minimum fee density exists and it shows how miners cannot create enormous
spam blocks for "no cost," for example. "

Dear Peter,

This might very well not be the case. Since the expected revenue *<V>* in
our formulas is but a lower bound to the true expected revenue, and the fee
supply curve [image: M_s(Q)\propto 1/\langle V\rangle], if the true
expected revenue doesn't decay faster than the mempool's average
transaction fee (or, more simply, if it doesn't decay to zero) then the
maximum miner surplus will be unbounded and unhealthy fee markets will
emerge.

Best,
Daniele

Ah thanks!  I missed the version bump in BIP68.

Yes, but Mark pointed out that it has uses, so I withdraw the
suggestion.

Thanks,

Regardless of the XT debate, centralization on reddit and bitcointalk has become a critical issue for the bitcoin community. A few anonymous people control both these forums, giving them unprecedented power to manipulate discussion, alter reputation, ban users, and even to facilitate scammers in the name of getting profits. Protecting the de-centralized spirit of the Bitcoin community is no longer on their list of priorities, in fact those in charge have publicly stated centralization is necessary. It doesn't matter how many thousands of posts you contributed or if you've traded thousands of Bitcoins, if one of the few who control reddit and bitcointalk decide to get rid of you there's nothing you can do. Bitcointalk has done more damage to my reputation than any other website I've ever used, and I only used it for a year. The damage wasn't even from the scammers, but rather those in charge of the community posting false allegations with zero evidence, and enforcing a guilty until proven innocent policy. Even when such allegations are definitively proven incorrect and allegations cease the posts stay on the internet forever, another site crawls all the bitcoin discussion and saves it. It's not an isolated incident either, happened several times to me before I realized how detrimental it was to even post there, and I've seen countless other members receive the same treatment. 

There is no doubt that the centralization and censorship of the Bitcoin community is massively inhibiting the advance of Bitcoin and also the growth of the Bitcoin economy. We are scaring away intellectuals, businessman, and newbies that are just getting started. It has put us in a very dangerous position, the community has been weakened, and there is the possibility that the forums could be handed over to the government at any time due to their centralized nature.  

I am creating a de-centralized forum, and I mean truly de-centralized as I nor anyone else will be able to control it. I am already writing the code and I'm confident it won't be long until a basic release is out. I am certain this will be very positive for the Bitcoin community, and the rest of the world since centralization is getting stronger everyday. The world needs this to level the playing field, it will be impossible for anything to be deleted on this forum even if the NSA attacks it. No one will be banned ever. The only rule is there are no rules.  

If anyone is interested in this feel free to email me back. I am doing this for zero profit and without any pay, just out of passion, so I don't mind getting as much people as possible involved.

Subject: [bitcoin-dev] Censorship


  
People are wondering why there is such a division in the bitcoin community at this time. Bitcoin as a whole is only so big. The bitcoin discussion communities are spread out, but there are only a few popular ones. BitcoinTalk and Reddit seem to be the largest, most popular where bitcoin discussion happens consistently and from almost everyone in the community (devs, users, btc companies, merchants, and so on). I think we all know where this is going. If not, here you go. BitcoinTalk and Reddit are managed by a single person: Theymos. It's become quite clear over the past several days/weeks, that Theymos is highly censoring bitcoin discussion, mainly on Reddit, but also BitcoinTalk. If this single person is able to censor content, and hush the debate, he (and whatever his agenda is), wins. How can we as a community discuss these proposed changes, if the discussion is from a one sided point of view? There doesn't seem to be a solution at this time, but I find it dissapointing that many (in this very email list) aren't discussing this important part of the issue. Maybe it's becuase Theymos is anti-bigger blocks, which seems to coincide with the Blockstream point of view, which many of the core devs belong to.

Zander is working on the same thing: https://www.reddit.com/r/AetheralResearch/

But it's actually quite difficult to make it truly censorship-resistant: both in solving the theymos factor and spam/abuse/overloading as an attack.

We have /r/bitcoinxt and so far it has been great. But we also need a regular forum.

Roger Ver controls bitcoin.com, as I understand? https://bitcoin.com/forum/ would be nice.

And it must be a real community, not "say whatever you want because free speech". We've seen how that turned out to be.

Something like battle.net or Steam forums: heavily moderated, not for opinions, but for spam/noise/insults.

Again, this needs leadership. Anyone can install a forum software, what is needed is an "official seal of approval" and regular presence of top XT people there.

And a will to setup proper moderation. Then people will move.

 When I say de-centralized I mean it, all the things you listed are centralized. Reddit is actually a purely centralized system and just as unhealthy as the current bitcoin forum. We have the technology, I'm simply putting together the pieces that other people have already built. This forum will literally be uncontrollable in raw form, once it's unleashed it can't be stopped. It will exist on thousands of computers so it cannot be destroyed, it will not be centrally hosted. 

I expect users to create their own external software to parse the data, so people can centralize as much or as little as they want in their own 'sub-forums' built on this system. I will be releasing some very rudimentary external software/website to go along with this de-centralized system just so people can post and read what's posted, and will worry about the finer details at a later time.

There will be various leaders who utilize this program and organize quality forums, but fundamentally the raw de-centralized system cannot be controlled, so people posting to it will always have a venue to speak without being censored.

I actually started this project to create a journal of uncensored scientific research, but it didn't take long to realize this sort've thing is useful for pretty much everyone, so I'm rushing the basic release out. Then I will work on making my science journal 'sub-forum' software and everyone else can do whatever they want.

Wow. I have Deja Vu. Where have I heard recently that discussing Bitcoin split is off topic and must be stopped?.. Hm...

This is the biggest issue with Bitcoin right now and you want us to move to some obscure place?

Where? Reddit?  Where we can't be heard? Create another list with top XT people then.

This is a technical list dedicated to technical discussions revolving
around the bitcoin protocol and related technologies. What I am saying
is your discussion topic is not relevant to the long established theme
of this list. Please have a bit of decorum and respect for people who
joined this list so they could participate in and review
technical/academic topics.

Clearly there *should* be a general bitcoin discussion list somewhere,
I don't disagree (and I have repeatedly asked for one to be created),
but regardless, this list isn't it. The flood of off topic and
non-technical posts make it almost impossible to follow any technical
proposals.

Please, this has drifted so far from the goal of this list: bitcoin development, and technical and academic debate about that.

Meta-discussion of communities has no place here.

I'd say: in the spirit of permissionlessness, everyone can create a community or list about bitcoin. If you don't agree with the admin, create your own. That's more constructive use of everyone's time and energy than trying to pressure people to change their behavior on their own home turf.

Thanks for nice decentralized discussion.
This wasn't and isn't a parody.
Mining is insecure (for society) and security is passive.
All the raised points are proven by esteemed members themselves.

Closing from my side.
Thanks,

One last comment here on this topic;

For anybody who wants to discuss decentralized communication mechanisms in
general, they can come to www.reddit.com/r/p2pcomms (up until these
decentralized forums have become stable and common).

I've seen quite a few more of these projects lately, I want to make a list
of them and would definitely like to contribute to making them not just
usable, but good enough to gain popularity on their own.

(And in case you wonder about my approach to moderation: let every user
pick which moderators / filters / servers he trusts, and let them share
their subscription preferences in place of sharing links to centralized

The de-centralized forum directly integrates the Bitcoin blockchain with every post. I can see how you misunderstood since I wasn't specific in my first email. I'm surprised no one has done this yet, people have done things very similar but never took the leap to integrate the actual Bitcoin blockchain. Basically http://cryptograffiti.info/ but with a parallel program that stores most of the data in a hash reference table, and shares that data via a torrent-esque system.
 
  The Bitcoin of thoughts.

One last comment here on this topic;
  
For anybody who wants to discuss decentralized communication mechanisms in general, they can come to www.reddit.com/r/p2pcomms (up until these decentralized forums have become stable and common).
  
I've seen quite a few more of these projects lately, I want to make a list of them and would definitely like to contribute to making them not just usable, but good enough to gain popularity on their own. 
  
(And in case you wonder about my approach to moderation: let every user pick which moderators / filters / servers he trusts, and let them share their subscription preferences in place of sharing links to centralized forums.)

Thanks for your summary. This one seems particularly interesting. 
However, it does not allow fine adjustment for each input and output 
separately, so I wonder if it really "fully enable any seen or unforseen 
use case of the CTransactionSignatureSerializer." as it claims.

Yup I've been looking over twister thoroughly this week, it's very close to what I'm thinking and I'm sure the developer of that could easily do the project I'm doing. However he decided to make an alt coin and didn't use the real blockchain, which makes his network weak. It's a waste to not take advantage of the immense bitcoin computing power for this. I'm only planning on storing hashes in the blockchain though to prevent data bloat, and the parallel program which stores all the data will be a lot like twister. Additionally I'm going to take it beyond a messaging system, will be able to literally upload anything and everything to this system. Theres no limit to what this de-centralized system can do if designed correctly. Crypto graffiti has given a taste of that by uploading jpeg and png to the blockchain. 

Will be working on this 24/7 until the first release, will definitely tell you and others when the code is ready to be looked over. Fortunately I am employed by bitcoin so I can focus on this

The reason for 60% of block were generated in China is same as the 
reason for 60% of your clothes were made in China. The electricity there 
is the cheapest on the planet. Many dams were built in the past 10 years 
and now they have huge amount of surplus electricity due to economic 
downturn.

Not sure if you are aware of this thread: 
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1072474.0 . Could you imagine 
this in any developed country? As long as mining is largely dependent on 
energy, there is no hope to break the balance/imbalance.

Bandwidth is probably only a few percent of miners' cost. There is no 
evidence that the current level of centralization is a result of block 
size. Instead, clear evidence has shown that centralization is a result 
of pool mining*, invention of ASIC, and disparity of energy cost. (* 
People started pool mining in 2010 because they wanted lower variance, 
not because of the inability to run a full node)

Even if we could quantify the level of centralization, it is a continuum 
and we must compromise between utility and centralization. Unless 
BIP101/103 is adopted, adjusting the hard cap always require a hardfork. 
For obvious technical and political reasons we can't have hardfork too 
frequently. Therefore, we need to leave some leeway: the hard cap may be 
a bit too high for today, but we are sure that technology will catch up 
in the near future.

Assuming we have plenty amount of "benevolent" miners, they will keep 
the block size low unless there is a real demand for larger block space. 
This is different from setting an individual soft limit, as that will 
lead to block size scarcity and therefore higher tx fee, which may be 
good for all miners. And as we say "miners can always decrease the block 
size with softfork or 51% attack", BIP100 materializes this possibility 
in a much smoother way.

I say "lucky" because I wholeheartedly believe it is good to keep the 
block as small as we really need. We can't do this by an equation so I 
would prefer to leave the power to miners (and they always have this 
power, anyway).

Jeff and Satoshi discussed this in 2010, although the flame throwing

The problem is the definition of "urgency" itself is controversial. And 
I believe an urgent hardfork should only be done as a bug fix, not 
implementation of a new feature. Block size increase should be a planned 
feature, as we don't want the tx fee raised to 10USD, before suddenly 
dropping to 0.01USD with the hardfork.

I don't think it's urgent today because my free tx always get mined. I 
don't know what is urgent and different people have different 
definition, but in general I think that should be measured by tx fee in 
USD. 0.001USD/byte may be intolerable for many people. (It's about 
$0.0001/byte now, and $0.0005/byte when it was $1200/BTC). It's not 
difficult to reach this level given the halving and potential bull 
market is coming.

As I argued above, it's already too late when things become really 
urgent. That will lead to serious market disruption, and the uncertainty 
could be very harmful to the development of the bitcoin economy.

As I said above, strictly limiting the block size may have little effect 
on mining centralization (because block size at this level is not a 
determining factor), while it may seriously suppress the utility.

I'm all for mining decentralization but block size is just not the right 
way to improve the situation.

I agree with you, but the balance between centralization and utility is 
also important. (and I believe the difference between 1MB and 8MB is 
tolerable, at least I must keep my full node running at this level)

I also have an idea to have a "decentralizedcoin", with very small 
blocks and everyone could mine with a CPU. That would be interesting if 
it is backed by famous devs in this area and is not 
yet-another-scamcoin.

I don't believe that any Bitcoin user actually cares about
decentralization, because none of them I've asked can define that term.

"decentralization" has become a placeholder word for "features or ideas
that I like" and it's long past time to drag the discussion back into
the realm of concrete and achievable goals.

I think there are a few specific things we can surmise about what users
might mean when they say they want Bitcoin to be "decentralized":

* They should own their bitcoins, meaning that they retain exclusive
control over their balances. Even more precisely, the network must
always honour the conditions of the scripts associated with unspent outputs.

* Their fraction of the Bitcoin ledger must not be diluted.

* When they decide to spend their coins, they will be able to do so
without requiring permission from a third party.

A decentralized architecture in certain parts of the network can be
helpful for achieving those goals, but it is not always necessary, nor
is it always sufficient to achieve them.

It's been quite impressive to see so many Bitcoin users and developers
saying, "Bitcoin is totally decentralised because it's open source and
nobody is in charge...... oh nooooooo we didn't mean you could change *those
lines! *If you want to change *those lines* then *we* must agree first!"

Believing simultaneously that:

1. Bitcoin is decentralised

2. Nobody should modify the code in certain ways without the agreement of
me and my buddies

is just doublethink.

What is Bitcoin if not decentralized?

Bitcoin the most awkward, unprivate and damaging currencies ever
created.  It is terribly slow for general use, and it is very
difficult for users to get over the technical hurdles required to use
it safety.  It is simultaneously the least private payment system ever
conceived for general use, yet still manages to consistently help
terrorists and pedophiles.  Over half a gigawatt of power is used to
power the miners which timestamp the network, causing hundreds of
millions of tonnes of CO2 and radioactive particles to be spewed into
the atmosphere.

Perhaps we can justify these damages as the cost of decentralization,
similar to one justifying the tor anonymity network as having
significant positive effects outweighing the negative.  However if you
are truly willing to give the goal of absolute decentralization up as
unachievable or unrealistic, it would be much more sensible to replace
the entire Bitcoin network with a couple of geographically distributed
SQL servers and call it a day.

Without decentralization as an ultimate goal, Bitcoin is an
abomination that is best dismantled.

You don't understand what value proof of work provides, or what features
differentiate good money from poor money, and you can't make a
defensible statement of Bitcoin's value proposition.

Because you can't do these things, you assume nobody else can do them
either and therefore the only way for Bitcoin to survive is to sweep the
problem under the rug and distract users with a word that means nothing
(and therefore means whatever the observer wants it to mean).

This is not a strategy that can be successful in the long term.

Personally, as more big companies pile up the hardware, I think
decentralization will suffer. If bitcoin winds up where only those with
enough money to buy expensive mining equipment are left, what is that but
another form of centralization (where a few companies hold all the power
over mining). I see this as more of a long term threat to bitcoin than the
current blocksize debate, XT or anything else.
Just my opinion.

Proof of work is probabilistic transaction ordering (and timestamping
by extension), the only perceivable value in it is that it is
decentralized. If you don't have that set as a requirement there are
plenty of companies around who will act as a time stamping notary for
you, just as there are many cloud services around to host the SQL-
based Bitcoin replacement.

Even so, decentralization is a means to an end - not an end-goal.  It is
essential for Bitcoin to be a useful alternative, of course.

The justification for the existence of Bitcoins hinges on it.  What is
described in the whitepaper is a system without the trust of third
parties to process electronic payments, this can not exist without
decentralization.  Absent any unforseen revelations this is a
requirement rather than a suggestion or fleeting fancy.  Below a
decentralized Bitcoin you are free to make systems as centralized as
you please without affecting the parent, below a centralized Bitcoin
there is no room to make it less.  We really only have one shot at a
properly bootstrapped, decentralized currency, and it would be a great
shame to mess up the one we have with hasty decision making for
unclear goals.

You keep using the word "decentralized" without explaining (and most
likely, understanding) what it means.

You say:

> a system without the trust of third parties to process electronic payments

What does it mean to use a decentralized network instead of a trusted
third party to process electronic payments? What undesirable actions can
a trusted third party perform that a decentralized network can not perform?

The answer to those questions are the *actual* goals, for which
decentralization is just one portion of a solution.

It might be helpful to organize Bitcoin's various existing, potential,
rejected, and proposed features using the Kano model:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model

Example: The ability of one entity to spend another entity's Bitcoins
without their consent is a reverse quality.

It would at least give us something objective to talk about.

Hi folks,

I think we should agree to disable the ability to subscribe with digests on
bitcoin-dev list.  I think digests were from an earlier era of Internet
history.  Digests are inconvenient for everyone because replies have the
problem of breaking threads.    These days people should be setting mail
filters to separate list mail from other mail.  I think digests are really
not a net-positive for the community so we should just turn off the ability
to do it.

Any objections?

Decentralization is a ubiquitous term within the Bitcoin, and the
definition is by no measure new or often confused.  It is realizing
that systems involving trusted third parties have undesirable
properties, be it regarding privacy, fraud, censorship, and removing
the effect of them as much as is physically possible.  WASTE and
RetroShare are examples of decentralized messaging and file
distribution systems, acknowledging the privacy problems involved with
centralized systems like AOL Instant Messenger or IRC.

Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which allows any person the
ability to transact in a way that does not require specific trust in
any particular party.  Users can independently verify that
transactions they receive are valid and confirmed, with strong
confidence that they can not be reversed or modified.  A third party
does not hold these same properties, there is no reason to believe the
information they present other than trust they will not lie, cheat, or
violate privacy at their own will.  Given information by a trusted
third party (such as a balance or existance of transaction), a person
has no ability to independently validate their claims as you do in a
decentralized system.

This is on the right track, but still falls short in a few areas.

It's a false dichotomy to say that our choices are: Bitcoin as it exists
today (or in some theoretical perfect state of decentralization), or an
Excel spreadsheet edited by a trusted third party who can change any
number to be any other number they want.

Imagine there was only one miner in the network. In spite of being the
sole entity creating the blockchain there would still be many actions
they could *not* do:

* Falsify ECDSA signatures
* Generate proof of work without expending energy
* Produce blocks that non-mining nodes would recognize as including
invalid transactions (including printing themselves unlimited balances)
* Force other people to purchase the coins they mine so that they can
pay their electric bills

What they *can* do is:

* Defraud recipients of transactions by including a payment transaction
in a block, then orphaning that block with another block that contains a
conflicting transaction (double spend).

There is usually*** a cost to performing this attack, so miners would
only be expected to do it if the benefit exceeds the cost.

* Prevent the inclusion of valid transactions into any block using any
criteria they want.

The worse case scenario for mining monopolization is that the risk of
profitable double spends means that transactions might require more
confirmations to be reliable, and that some entity can censor
transactions at will.

Those aren't exactly end-of-the world failure cases. They are certainly
undesirable and every means of preventing them should be investigated,
but it does mean that it should be possible to dial back on the
catastrophe language when analysing possible failure modes.

The weakest area for Bitcoin to be attacked is via censorship enforced
by miners.

The first line of defence is to improve the privacy features of wallets
to the point at which blacklists are not effective. I'm confident that
this can be achieved.

That leaves the censors with the choice of whether or not to escalate to
whitelisting, which ultimately can be countered by users switching to a
new system which does not have that particular anti-feature.

tl;dr: Bitcoin security does not lie on a one-dimensional "centralized
vs decentralized" axis. Treating it as if it does removes the clarity
that is needed in order to effectively solve problems.

***Exploring the exact conditions under which this is true is an
interesting exercise and relevant to long term discussions vis a vis the
block subsidy and transaction fees in the future.

I agree.  What about decentralization in development?  Gavin recently said that he wants to "get to the point where there will be multiple robust implementations of the core protocol."

When I look at this image (https://i.imgur.com/zivHJvY.gif) illustrating centralization in nodes, mining and development, the biggest source of concern for me is the 85% node share around Bitcoin Core.  With this level of centralization, it may be possible in the future for a group of coders to prevent important changes from being made in a timely fashion (e.g., should their interests no longer align with those of the larger Bitcoin community).  

It is my opinion, then, that we should support multiple implementations of the Bitcoin protocol, working to reduce the network's dependency on Core.  

Best regards,
Peter R

Indeed, for an occasional reader perspective, nightmarish. List signature
also a bit annoying but it's possible to live with it.

Decentralization depends on the context and does not have a definition
in a form that it was demanded... I can confirm we have people in our
community which do understand decentralization, and quite good
actually, just there is no definition if the form demanded.

It is known that ~90% (at least of the nodes accepting incoming
connections) are running Bitcoin Core software. This does not mean
that Bitcoin is somehow less decentralized. Bitcoin Core is open
source, it has many contributors from all over the world and there are
many pull requests - most of them do get merged if you check the
commit history. It is widely used because the quality of the code is 5
stars. There are other implementations as well, they are just not
widely used. This does not mean one is not free to write his own
implementation of the Bitcoin protocol (assuming he follows the
consensus rules of the network). The biggest problem is convincing
users to adopt that implementation, which is a normal thing which
happens in general, not only related to software implementations.

The problem is there is no other implementation out there which comes
near the quality of the code in Bitcoin Core. I am actually eager to
try other implementations as well, but something serious, because
Bitcoin itself is a payment protocol not something to play with.

This is the reason why a lot of developers contribute to Bitcoin Core
rather than writing their own implementation. This only makes Bitcoin
Core stronger, better, and obviously the result is that it has
majority in the ecosystem for good reasons. If I'm experienced in a
certain segment related to software developing, I am better of in
contributing to Bitcoin Core just with the part I know instead of
writing from scratch my own implementation.
